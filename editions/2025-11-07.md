  <blockquote class="quote">“Dust, wind and sand dynamics appear to be the main seasonal drivers of slope streak formation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter captured dust avalanches on Apollinaris Mons slopes on 24 December 2023 after a meteoroid shook the mountain edge and triggered about a hundred new streaks. Additional imagery dated the impact and streak formation to 2013–2017. A Nature Communications study used deep learning on over two million MRO streaks (2006–2024) and found streaks clustered in five hotspots, concluding that fewer than one in a thousand were caused by impacts and that seasonal wind- and dust-driven dry processes dominated.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Insects seem to cope quite well in space environments.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Long before humans reached orbit, insects had shown they could endure spaceflight. Light, adaptable and nutritious, they were considered by ESA researchers as potential food for long missions. Experiments since the 1940s showed microgravity did not majorly disrupt development or behaviour for many species. The team found insects could recycle nutrients and produce sustainable protein, but researchers studied microgravity effects on life cycles, physiology and reproduction. Fruit flies had been the first animal to survive spaceflight in 1947 and completed life cycles in microgravity.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We've got several more New Glenn boosters already in production.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin announced a November 9 target for New Glenn’s second launch, to carry NASA’s twin Escapade satellites. New Glenn had flown its maiden flight in January but failed to land its first stage; CEO Dave Limp said another failed landing would not be a problem because more boosters were in production. Advanced Space designed a trajectory that placed the satellites at Sun–Earth L2, enabling a 2026 Earth slingshot to reach Mars in 2027. Launch was planned from Cape Canaveral at 2:45 ET.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Starlink Group 11-14 lifted off atop a Falcon 9 rocket”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Nov. 6 SpaceX launched 28 Starlink satellites (Starlink Group 11-14) from Vandenberg Space Force Base at 4:13 p.m. EST (2113 GMT; 1:13 p.m. local). The Falcon 9 booster B1093 flew its eighth mission, separated, performed deceleration burns and landed on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You about 8.5 minutes after liftoff; upper stage released the satellites about an hour into flight, adding to a constellation of over 8,800. It was the year's 142nd Falcon 9 launch and the 102nd Starlink mission.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“practical innovation and strong partnerships”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Heineken partnered with EDP and Rondo to install a 100 MWh grid- and solar-powered Rondo Heat Battery at its Lisbon brewery that stored heat in refractory bricks and converted it to steam. The system was expected to supply 7 MW of steam—enough to run the brewery 24 hours—and go live in April 2027. EDP would build and operate it and Rondo would supply the technology; Heineken said it advanced its 2040 net-zero goal and Portugal's 2030 targets.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The images clearly showed the comet's distinctive features, consisting of a nucleus and a surrounding coma.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">China's Tianwen 1 Mars orbiter imaged interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its Oct. 1–4 close pass by Mars, producing images from 18 million miles (28.96 million km) away with the HiRIC camera that showed a nucleus and coma. The operation tracked a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) object moving at 129,800 mph (58 km/s), aided global observations, and served as an extension mission and technical test in preparation for Tianwen 2. Tianwen 1 had launched July 2020 and deployed the Zhurong rover in 2021.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MIT SEES UNCONVENTIONAL SUPERCONDUCTIVITY IN GRAPHENE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;The superconducting gap gives us a clue to what kind of mechanism can lead to things like room-temperature superconductors.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT physicists reported direct evidence of unconventional superconductivity in magic-angle twisted tri-layer graphene (MATTG). They measured MATTG’s superconducting gap and found it differed from that of typical superconductors, indicating an unconventional pairing mechanism. The result, published in Science, was obtained with a new experimental platform that monitored the gap emerging in real time; the team planned to apply the platform to further probe MATTG and other two-dimensional materials to guide future superconductor design.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The accurate measurement structure of the photon rings and of their location represents the most compelling route to investigate gravity in the regime of strong but stationary…”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers noted that the Event Horizon Telescope had produced first images of black-hole environs and that extreme gravity could amplify deviations from general relativity. They tested a parametric Konoplya–Rezzolla–Zhidenko metric by varying two parameters (four cases) and compared them to the Kerr metric. They ran hydrodynamic simulations including infalling matter, magnetic fields and jets, produced ring-like images like the EHT’s, and found subtle but present differences. They concluded that photon-ring measurements from next-generation telescopes could potentially discriminate among gravity models.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“prepare for the worst.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An expert warned the bird flu virus infecting UK farm flocks could be the most infectious yet. Professor Ian Brown of the Pirbright Institute said farmers should &quot;prepare for the worst.&quot; A mandatory housing order in England was brought into force; a producer said she felt terrible housing 32,000 hens but an outbreak would be disastrous. Since October there had been 26 HPAI H5N1 farm cases (22 in England), and flocks were culled. He recalled the 2021–23 epidemic of over 350 outbreaks and urged biosecurity.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“One of the challenges with mRNA vaccines is the cost.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed a lipid nanoparticle that they said could make mRNA vaccines more effective and reduce dose and cost. In mice, an mRNA influenza vaccine delivered with the new LNP produced the same immune response as vaccines using FDA-approved materials at about 1/100 the dose. The study, led by Daniel Anderson and colleagues, appeared in Nature Nanotechnology; the particles were proposed for COVID-19 vaccines and to potentially lower side effects.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“enshrine the inviolability of the human mind”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Unesco adopted global ethical standards for neurotechnology, prompted by AI advances and a proliferation of consumer-grade devices. The standards defined a new category, “neural data”, and offered more than 100 recommendations covering rights-based protections, mental privacy and freedom of thought, and speculative risks such as subliminal marketing during dreams. The move followed heavy investment in neurotech (including Merge Labs and Meta’s wristband) and parallel policy efforts such as a WEF paper and the proposed US Mind Act.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Reaching this milestone is a tremendous achievement.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">After arriving at the California launch site at the end of September, two identical HydroGNSS microsatellites were prepared for liftoff later that month as ESA’s first Scout mission. They underwent final checks — testing, propellant loading, battery charging and launch-adapter integration — and were cleared for rocket-fairing closure before sharing a SpaceX Falcon 9 Transporter-15 launch from Vandenberg. In 180°-separated orbits they would use GNSS reflectometry to measure soil moisture, freeze–thaw state, inundation and above-ground biomass.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“it did not activate the planetary defense protocol”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Comet 3I/Atlas recently reached perihelion and moved away from the Sun at about 210,000 km/h, on a trajectory calculated to escape the solar system in January 2026. Its anomalous composition and age indicated an extrasolar origin. Astronomers had confidently predicted its path; on December 19 it passed about 270 million km from Earth and was observable only with powerful telescopes. Public sites and NASA’s Eyes on the Solar System simulator provided real‑time tracking and maps.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“You put your finger in and remove it instantaneously, it's unbearable.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers found Amazon lakes had warmed and shrunk during severe 2023–24 droughts, with shallow Lake Tefé (2 m) reaching 41°C and other lakes exceeding 37°C. Floating carcasses of up to 200 endangered pink river dolphins washed up over six weeks around September 2023. The Science study reported lakes had warmed 0.3–0.8°C per decade, and Lake Tefé and Lake Badajós lost about 75% and 90% of surface area respectively.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“At the bottom of it, quite literally, we’re trying to understand what these objects are, because they don’t exist in our solar system.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Kepler and TESS had found sub-Neptunes were common; scientists had assumed they began as long-lived magma oceans because dense hydrogen-rich envelopes trapped heat. New research, &quot;Not All Sub-Neptune Exoplanets Have Magma Oceans&quot; (ApJ Letters) led by Eliza Kempton, modelled interiors with an iron core, silicate mantle and mixed H/He/H2O envelope with an Earth-like iron-to-silicate ratio, varying five inputs including mass and mean molecular weight. They found some sub-Neptunes could host solid silicate surfaces; GJ 1214 b's high-MMW hazy atmosphere exemplified a heavier envelope.</p>

  <p class="dek">Typhoon Kalmaegi was one of 2025's strongest storms, caused severe flooding in the Philippines and left at least 114 dead before heading for Vietnam. The article said climate change was not thought to increase the number of tropical cyclones but warmer oceans and atmosphere could make those that formed more intense, raising wind speeds, rainfall and coastal flooding. Tropical cyclones formed over warm tropical oceans from disturbances as warm moist air rose and rotation induced spinning; major hurricanes were category three (≥111 mph/178 km/h).</p>

  <p class="dek">The U.S. military test-launched an unarmed Minuteman III ICBM, Glory Trip 254, from Vandenberg on Nov. 5 at 1:35 a.m. PT. The missile briefly left the atmosphere and traveled about 4,200 miles, impacting at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site in the Marshall Islands. Air Force Global Strike Command oversaw the launch, which was triggered from an E-6B Mercury via the Airborne Launch Control System to assess readiness as Minuteman III was being phased out for the LGM-35 Sentinel by 2030.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“All these clocks are intrinsically quantum.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that atomic clocks, which tracked electron transitions in atoms like rubidium, strontium and ytterbium, kept extreme time (losing one second every 10 million years) and could enable navigation in far-off environments including interstellar space and help study dark matter or earthquakes. Two studies in Nature and Science Advances used quantum techniques to improve optical-clock stability; MIT’s Vladan Vuletić was senior author on the Nature paper. Optical ytterbium clocks measured ~100 trillionth-second intervals but faced quantum &quot;noise&quot; from the Heisenberg limit.</p>

  <p class="dek">An international team led by UC Berkeley reported the tidal disruption event AT 2024tvd in a galaxy 600 million light‑years away. A black hole tore a star apart about 2,600 light‑years from the galaxy’s center, producing the fastest‑evolving radio emission of its kind. Multi‑telescope radio observations (VLA, ALMA, ATA, SMA, AMI‑LA) revealed a double‑peaked signal and modeling indicated at least two ejection events occurring months apart.</p>

  <p class="dek">Interplanetary dust carrying helium-3 that settled on the Arctic seafloor provided climate scientists with a historical sea-ice record needed to improve predictions. Pavia's team analyzed sediment cores from three Arctic sites and measured helium-3 (cosmic) and thorium-230 (from uranium decay); higher thorium-230/helium-3 ratios indicated periods of greater ice cover. The study addressed urgency from rapid Arctic warming, noting sea-ice had declined more than 42% since regular satellite monitoring began in 1979.</p>
