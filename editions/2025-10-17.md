  <h3 class="hed">TESLA MAD MAX FSD PROBE LAUNCHED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It hasn’t been out for 24 hours, and it has already been spotted rolling stop signs and driving more than 15 mph (24 km/h) over the speed limit.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Tesla reintroduced a Full Self-Driving mode called Mad Max, which allowed higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than the system’s Hurry mode and had previously been part of Autopilot in 2018. Electrek reported that within 24 hours it was observed rolling stop signs and exceeding speed limits by more than 15 mph. The US NHTSA had opened an investigation into FSD after over 50 safety reports and multiple crashes.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ANTARCTICA FACES GREENLAND FATE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We thought it was just going to take ages...&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists reported that Antarctica had started to mirror Greenland, showing increased surface melting, faster-flowing glaciers, shrinking sea ice and collapsing ice shelves, based on satellite and field observations. Researchers said earlier assumptions of Antarctic stability were wrong; the ice sheet covered about 5.4 million square miles, was over a mile thick on average, held 61% of Earth's fresh water (enough to raise sea level ~190 feet) and West Antarctica alone could raise over 10 feet. The 2002 Larsen B collapse exemplified rapid change.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;It's a pretty big bet.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Around the middle of last year, Pim de Witte spun Medal out into a new AI lab, General Intuition, after discovering its gaming-clip dataset (about 2 billion uploads per year from tens of thousands of games) had strong interest from AI labs and multiple acquisition offers (reports said OpenAI offered $500 million). General Intuition raised a $133.7 million seed round led by Vinod Khosla; other backers included General Catalyst and the Raine Group. The lab aimed to build world-model–style foundational models for spatially aware agents.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DRY ICE CARVES MARS GULLIES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It felt like I was watching the sandworms in the film 'Dune,'”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers simulated Martian dunes and showed that slabs of carbon dioxide ice formed in winter carved sinuous gullies as they sublimated in spring. In a Mars chamber at Utrecht University, trapped CO2 gas built pressure beneath ice blocks, vented and propelled the blocks downslope, plowing narrow trenches and levees. The experiments, led by Lonneke Roelofs and Simone Visschers, offered a water-free explanation for recent gullies; results were published Oct. 8 in Geophysical Research Letters.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AUSTRALIA'S RAINFORESTS NOW CARBON SOURCES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Current models may overestimate the capacity of tropical forests to help offset fossil fuel emissions.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers found Australia's tropical rainforests had shifted to releasing more carbon than they absorbed. A Nature study used 49 years of data from 20 Queensland forests and found that about 25 years earlier trunks and branches (woody biomass) became net emitters because tree deaths outpaced growth. Scientists attributed the change to extreme temperatures, atmospheric drying, drought and more frequent/severe cyclones and warned it could undermine models of forests' ability to offset fossil-fuel emissions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;stellar-only&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">After JWST surveyed early‑universe galaxies in December 2022, it detected compact, red “Little Red Dots” (LRDs). Astronomers debated whether LRDs were dusty, intensely star‑forming “stellar-only” systems or early active galactic nuclei hosting massive black holes. An international team led by Andres Escala concluded in a paper under review at the Astrophysical Journal that LRDs began as stellar‑only galaxies and later formed seeds of present‑day supermassive black holes.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we saw values that are very different from anything we find on Earth.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers led by James W. Dottin III at Brown University analyzed previously sealed Apollo 17 samples from a drive tube using secondary ion mass spectrometry and found unusually low sulfur-33 isotope ratios unlike Earth’s. The samples, thought to be mantle-derived volcanic rock, had been preserved under NASA’s ANGSA program and were studied with collaborators from UNM and WHOI; the team suggested one explanation was sulfur photochemistry under a short-lived lunar atmosphere.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“audible symptoms of disease often appear only at later stages of illness”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An article titled &quot;Stethoscope, meet AI...&quot; described that the stethoscope had been used for over 200 years as a staple clinical tool to amplify internal body sounds and remained a quick, accessible, cost-effective first assessment for heart or lung disease. It noted that audible symptoms often appeared only at later stages of illness, making treatment less effective, and that changes in heart sounds were not always clearly defined and could be difficult to hear.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I would say in this instance, the weather was more the challenge.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astrophotographer Josh Dury captured Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) over Somerset, U.K., on Oct. 12 ahead of its Oct. 21 close approach, showing a bright green coma and long diffuse tail with a pink aurora. He photographed it with a Sony A7S III and Sigma 135mm F/1.4 despite haze and high wind. The report explained the tail formed by sublimation then solar wind, that the comet was about magnitude +4.9 and would brighten before fading for over a thousand years beyond Neptune.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;MAPLE did not work.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Ph.D. candidate Shraddha Lall described experiments that measured individual differences in fruit fly behavior as the building blocks of personality. She and labmates measured 900 flies daily in simple mazes, transferring anesthetized flies by hand after their robot MAPLE failed on Day 1. Over a 500-day, year-and-a-half project she learned about personality components and the practical challenges of conducting research.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;there's a warmer, more welcoming feel.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ByteDance launched Doubao in 2023 as a personable, avatar-fronted AI assistant. After DeepSeek’s January surge briefly eclipsed it, Doubao regained China’s top AI-app position by August with 157 million monthly active users (DeepSeek 143M) and was ranked fourth globally by a16z. Doubao combined chat, audio, video, image and document generation, customizable agents, and deep Douyin integration to attract mainstream, less tech‑savvy users. ByteDance added features (sometimes copying rivals) and prioritized social sharing over raw model leadership.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“opt in to autonomous delivery”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Waymo announced a partnership with DoorDash to use its self-driving cars for deliveries in Phoenix, deploying vehicles when they were not transporting passengers. Deliveries were initially limited to DashMart orders, with plans to expand to local Phoenix merchants and more offerings. Customers had to place DoorDash orders and opt in to autonomous delivery, then retrieve orders from the car’s trunk. Waymo had run a similar Uber Eats program in 2024 and had abandoned long-haul truck plans in 2023.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">TIDAL TUGS TURN STARS HOT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The tides are changing for white dwarfs”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers found a class of ultracompact white dwarf binaries with orbital periods under an hour whose components were far hotter (10,000–30,000 K) and about twice as large as expected. McNeill et al. modeled tidal heating from mutual deformation, which converted orbital energy into heat and inflated the larger, less massive star, accelerating mass transfer and orbital shrinkage. They predicted observable gravitational-wave emission, possible Type Ia triggers, and planned to test carbon–oxygen binaries.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MARTIAN ICE MAY PRESERVE MICROBES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The radiolytic degradation of amino acids in pure ices was significantly slower than in silicates.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Phoenix Lander exposed subsurface ice in 2008 and orbiters later added evidence of vast buried ice on Mars. Astrobiology research by Alexander Pavlov (NASA Goddard) froze E. coli in pure water and regolith mixes at −51°C, irradiated samples with gamma rays equivalent to 20 million years and modeled 50 million years total, then analyzed amino acids. Amino acids degraded more slowly in pure ice than in silicates, suggesting microbes or biomolecules could persist in Martian ice and a rover could dig for them.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Flight Test 11 achieved all of its mission goals.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched the 11th Starship test in mid‑October; Flight Test 11 achieved all mission goals. Video showed the Super Heavy booster hover briefly over the Gulf of Mexico before plunging into the sea about 6.5 minutes after liftoff. The Starship system (Ship upper stage and Super Heavy) stood about 400 feet (122 m); the flight included Ship's soft landing in the Indian Ocean, Starlink mass‑simulator deployment, an in‑space Raptor relight, and a new Super Heavy landing‑burn sequence. The booster had flown once before.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“death fold proteins can make cells self-destruct.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Jon Hamilton reported that researchers explored the behavior of &quot;death fold&quot; proteins, which could trigger cell self-destruction. They investigated those proteins to understand why some cells died too early and why others did not die soon enough, and they sought ways to control that process.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">VEO 3.1 TURNS PHOTOS INTO MOVIES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“prompt adherence”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google released Veo 3.1, an update to its AI video-generation model that was available via the Gemini API and powered the Flow editor. It improved prompt adherence, converted uploaded images to video while generating audio simultaneously, and added Flow's &quot;Frame to Video&quot; feature for first/last-frame interpolation. Audio-generation also applied to clip extension and object insertion. Shared samples still looked uncanny and varied by prompt, and it was less realistic than OpenAI's Sora 2.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Jettison is complete.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky, completed a 6-hour, 9-minute spacewalk to install an Ekran-M molecular beam epitaxy semiconductor experiment on the Nauka module, connect power and mount a cassette, then remove and jettison an unused HDTV camera from Zvezda. Using the European Robotic Arm, they cleaned a service-module window and retrieved exposed material samples; the 82-kg camera was expected to burn up on reentry. It was Zubritsky's first EVA; Ryzhikov had logged 12h57m.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MILITARY CLEARS ROCKET ONSLAUGHT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“double its annual launch rate at Vandenberg from 50 to 100”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Department of the Air Force approved SpaceX’s plans to launch up to 100 missions per year from Vandenberg, including up to 95 Falcon 9 and up to five Falcon Heavy flights, after a final EIS and a Record of Decision on October 10. Vandenberg’s launches rose from one five years ago to 51 this year. The FAA would review commercial increases; the California Coastal Commission had rejected the proposal over noise. Authorization allowed redevelopment of SLC-6 with demolition and two new booster landing pads.</p>
