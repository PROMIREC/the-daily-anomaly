  <p class="dek">The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for discoveries in quantum mechanical tunneling and was announced by Nobel Committee Chair Olle Eriksson, Swedish Academy Secretary General Hans Ellegren and committee member Goran Johansson. The laureates were John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis, who appeared on screen.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics to Google's Chief Scientist of Quantum Hardware Michel Devoret, former Google employee John Martinis, and UC Berkeley professor John Clarke for the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantization in an electric circuit. Their 1984–85 experiments created a superconducting circuit with a Josephson Junction that enabled manipulation of quantum phenomena and underpinned today's superconducting qubits. It followed Google-linked Nobel wins in 2024.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter photographed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its Oct. 3 flyby, when the comet passed 19 million miles from Mars. CaSSIS captured imagery despite the object being 10,000–100,000 times fainter than typical targets. 3I/ATLAS had been discovered in July by ATLAS and was the third confirmed interstellar object after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov; astronomers thought it predated the solar system by about three billion years. Mars Express attempted imaging but did not resolve it due to shorter exposures.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life. I’m completely stunned.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Clarke (British, UC Berkeley), Michel Devoret (French, Yale) and John Martinis (UC Santa Barbara) for experiments that demonstrated macroscopic quantum tunnelling and energy quantisation in superconducting electrical circuits. Announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the 11m Swedish kronor prize recognised work in Clarke’s Berkeley lab in the 1980s that showed quantum behaviours could appear in macroscopic circuits, which paved the way for quantum cryptography and quantum computers.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“phosphine is not necessarily a biosignature”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The James Webb Space Telescope detected phosphine in the cold atmosphere of brown dwarf Wolf 1130C (0.1 ppm) in a triple system, matching models and abundances seen on Jupiter and Saturn. The finding underscored that phosphine was not necessarily a biosignature and highlighted that many brown dwarfs predicted to host detectable phosphine did not. The result related to the contentious 2020 claim of phosphine on Venus by Greaves et al., which remained fiercely debated.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STUDY: AUTISM HAS MANY CAUSES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The term ‘autism’ likely described multiple conditions.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">University of Cambridge researchers concluded autism was not a single condition with a single cause. They analyzed behavioral data from childhood and adolescence in the UK and Australia and genetic data from more than 45,000 people in European and US cohorts. Early-diagnosed children (before age 6) had different genetic profiles and earlier social/behavioral difficulties than those diagnosed after age 10, who showed adolescent-onset difficulties and greater predisposition to depression and ADHD-related profiles. The authors noted sample and measurement limitations and framed findings as a basis to improve diagnosis and therapies.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It was the 29th launch and landing for this particular booster, which is designated B1071.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base on Oct. 7, carrying 28 Starlink satellites, and lifted off at 11:54 p.m. EDT. The first stage (booster B1071) returned and landed on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You about 8.5 minutes after liftoff, marking its 29th launch and landing; the upper stage deployed the satellites about 60 minutes after launch. It was the 127th Falcon 9 flight of the year; over 8,500 Starlink satellites were operational.</p>

  <p class="dek">Using the GRAVITY+ interferometer on ESO’s VLT, researchers mapped the broad-line region of J0529 and found a 10,000 km/s gas outflow that had broadened its emission lines. The original 10-billion-solar-mass estimate had assumed line broadening reflected orbital velocity; after subtracting the outflow contribution the team recalculated the mass as ~800 million solar masses (about 10% of the original). J0529 lay 12.5 billion light-years away when the universe was 1.5 billion years old.</p>

  <p class="dek">The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis for discovering macroscopic quantum tunneling and energy quantization in an electrical circuit. The committee said the work enabled next-generation quantum technologies. The three split the $1.1 million prize; the ceremony was scheduled for Stockholm on December 10, 2025. They had used a Josephson-junction circuit oscillator on a ~1 cm microchip, reduced experimental noise, and measured escape times as current increased to demonstrate macroscopic tunneling.</p>

NS-36 was the 36th New Shepard flight, the 15th crewed flight, carrying six passengers: Jeff Elgin, Danna Karagussova, Clint Kelly III (veteran of NS-22), Aaron Newman, Vitalii Ostrovsky and one anonymous passenger. Flights lasted 10–12 minutes, reached the Kármán line and offered minutes of weightlessness; ticket prices were unrevealed.</p>

  <p class="dek">Tianwen-2 was about 43 million km from Earth and took a selfie on Oct 1 timed for China's National Day, showing the Five‑Starred Red Flag, the return capsule and Earth, imaged by its robotic‑arm camera. Launched May 28, it was China’s first asteroid sample‑return mission, scheduled to reach NEA 469219 Kamo'oalewa on 7 June 2026 to collect ~100 g, then perform an Earth gravity assist en route to comet 311P/PANSTARRS in Jan 2035. CNSA reported 131 days in orbit and successful instrument checks.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It is among the first pieces of AI filmmaking that truly does not suck.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A filmmaker used several AI tools (FLUX Kontext, Midjourney, ElevenLabs, Runway) to create an alien character, Tiggy, and repeatedly ran into visual and safety errors before coaxing eight minutes of scripted TV. He expanded the project into Neural Viz’s Monoverse—a mockumentary universe of gluron shows, podcasts, and lore—which became a cult hit online and was described as a historic accomplishment in AI filmmaking.</p>

  <p class="dek">Scientists said they developed the world’s first blood test to diagnose myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Researchers at the University of East Anglia and Oxford Biodynamics analysed DNA folding in blood from 47 severely affected patients and 61 healthy adults, found a consistent pattern, and reported a test with 92% sensitivity and 98% specificity in the Journal of Translational Medicine. Other experts urged caution and called for independent validation before clinical use.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we already know that females are twice as likely to suffer from depression in their lifetime than males”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An international study led by QIMR Berghofer found that women carried a higher genetic risk of major depression, identifying 16 genetic variants in women versus eight in men. The researchers reported many shared variants but a greater female burden possibly from female-specific variants. They analysed DNA from five cohorts (130,471 women and 64,805 men with depression; 159,521 women and 132,185 controls) and found stronger genetic correlations in women between depression and metabolic traits. The study noted non-genetic explanations and urged a multifaceted approach.</p>

It said President Trump had answered questions after announcing &quot;significant medical and scientific findings for America's children&quot; at the White House on Sept. 22. Federal health officials suggested a link between prenatal acetaminophen use and autism risk, though many health agencies called the research inconclusive.</p>

Carson Fuls at Mount Lemmon, A6 crossed from Leo Minor into Ursa Major and was seen Oct 4 as a fuzzy binocular patch. It had a ~1,350‑year inbound orbit, reached perihelion 0.53 AU on Nov 8, was shortened by Jupiter to ~1,150 years outbound, and reached aphelion ~219 AU circa 3175 AD.</p>
