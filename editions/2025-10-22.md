  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;harbour not one but two black holes circling each other in a twelve-year orbit&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers observed, for the first time, two black holes orbiting each other in quasar OJ287, 4 billion light-years away, in work led by Mauri J. Valtonen and an international team. A 1982 prediction by Aimo Sillanpää had proposed a 12-year orbital cycle; the primary was estimated at 18 billion solar masses and the secondary at 150 million. The secondary was reported to impact the primary's accretion disk twice per orbit. TESS detected light in 2021 but resolving the pair required high-resolution VLBI including RadioAstron.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The vehicle will next proceed with planned vertical integration rehearsal”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Chinese company LandSpace conducted a static-fire test of its reusable Zhuque-3 launcher on Oct. 20, completing the three-day first phase of its maiden flight campaign that included a fueling test at the Dongfeng Commercial Space Innovation Pilot Zone. LandSpace said the vehicle was to undergo a vertical integration rehearsal and inspections ahead of an orbital debut and first-stage recovery planned before year-end. Zhuque-3’s booster used nine in-house Tianque-12A methane/LOX engines; it stood 66 m and could loft ~18,300 kg to LEO, similar to Falcon 9.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Light moves about six inches, or 15 centimeters, per frame of this video.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Brian Haidet, a scientist who posted as AlphaPhoenix, demonstrated a DIY camera that captured a laser pointer at two billion frames per second. It was an update of a previous one-billion-fps design but recorded only one pixel at a time. The rig used a gimbal-mounted mirror, two tubes, a simple lens, a light sensor and Python code; Haidet tiled many synchronized one-pixel recordings to produce a viewable video, noting a full traditional 2-billion-fps camera would be far more expensive.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This work uncovers the unexpected solid-state molecular mixing of nonpolar hydrocarbons—such as methane and ethane—with hydrogen cyanide (HCN)&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article reported that new PNAS research found hydrogen cyanide (HCN) could form solid-state molecular mixtures with nonpolar hydrocarbons (methane and ethane) under Titan's frigid conditions. Led by Martin Rahm, the study titled &quot;Hydrogen cyanide and hydrocarbons mix on Titan&quot; challenged chemical convention about polarity, noted Titan's nitrogen–methane atmosphere resembled early Earth, and suggested such mixing could reshape understanding of chemical processes across the Solar System.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">CHARTS EXPOSE MAKERS' MOTIVES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“visualizations do more than just communicate the data they are depicting”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers found that people’s trust in charts depended on assumptions about who created them: viewers inferred makers’ social identities and motives from design features (color, arrangement), which could lead to dismissing visuals on contentious topics. Qualitative and quantitative studies showed these inferences were widespread and not explained by data literacy. The team produced a framework for communicators, and two related papers were to be presented at the IEEE Visualization Conference. The study was led by Arvind Satyanarayan, Amy Rae Fox, Michelle Morgenstern, and Graham M. Jones.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;The most dangerous asteroids are the most difficult to detect.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Carnegie scientist Scott S. Sheppard discovered asteroid 2025 SC79 using the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco 4‑meter telescope; the finding was later confirmed by Gemini and Magellan telescopes. 2025 SC79 became the 39th Atira—an asteroid whose orbit lay entirely within Earth’s—and was only the second known inside Venus’s orbit, crossing Mercury’s orbit with a 128‑day period. It was about 700 m across, hid in the Sun’s glare, and disappeared behind the Sun pending follow‑up to study its composition and possible main‑belt origin.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ANCIENT VOLCANO MAY BE AWAKENING</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It has to release somehow in the future, either violently or more quietly.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that Taftan, a 13,000-foot stratovolcano in southeastern Iran, had been dormant for about 700,000 years but showed frequent fumarolic activity. Satellite interferometry detected roughly 3.5 inches of summit uplift between July 2023 and May 2024 that had not subsided, leading authors to conclude gas was accumulating and could be released in the future. They said there was no imminent eruption, noted limited ground monitoring and regional instability, and recommended enhanced long-term surveillance and hazard mitigation.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SILENT SYNAPSES ROAR TO LIFE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““We’d like to have the levers to push to make synapses stronger or weaker, that’s for sure.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT Picower Institute researchers tracked how synaptic active zones matured in fruit‑fly larvae. They photoconverted mMaple fused to a glutamate‑receptor component to mark synapse birth and followed assembly of proteins. New zones were initially nonfunctional, later supported spontaneous glutamate release as early proteins accumulated, and only after more proteins arrived did calcium-triggered evoked release occur. Maturation took days and was activity‑dependent. Yuliya Akbergenova led the Oct. 14 Journal of Neuroscience study; Troy Littleton noted disease relevance and NIH funding.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">HERA, CLIPPER COULD NET COMET IONS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Tailcatcher&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A preprint by Samuel Grand and Geraint Jones proposed using Hera and Europa Clipper to sample ions from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS's tail. They reported Hera would pass downwind Oct 25–Nov 1 and Europa Clipper Oct 30–Nov 6, while the comet had been producing a large, growing tail of water and ions. Using the &quot;Tailcatcher&quot; model they estimated minimum miss distances of ~8.2 million km (Hera) and ~8 million km (Europa Clipper), but solar‑wind uncertainty limited accuracy; ion spread might still allow detection.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">TITAN ICE DEFIES CHEMISTRY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This can happen at very low temperatures, like those on Titan.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Laboratory experiments at NASA JPL and computer simulations at Chalmers University showed that frozen hydrogen cyanide crystals could incorporate liquid methane and ethane, forming stable co-crystals under Titan-like temperatures (~−180°C). The finding contradicted the expected &quot;like dissolves like&quot; behavior of polar HCN and nonpolar hydrocarbons and explained surprising JPL measurements; Rahm's calculations also predicted light spectra that matched NASA's observations. Hydrogen cyanide had been formed in Titan's atmosphere by UV-driven reactions.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MIT-IBM LAB SPARKS AI REVOLUTION</h3>
  
  <p class="dek">MIT and IBM were early AI contributors, and their MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, launched eight years earlier, continued to deliver research for industry. The lab produced 54 patent disclosures, over 128,000 citations (h-index 162), and more than 50 industry use cases, and achieved advances from AI imaging for improved stent placement to smaller models and silicate interatomic potentials. The lab aligned research with IBM on LLMs, AI hardware and foundation models, while students aided deployment; reports warned many generative-AI projects would be abandoned.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the 133rd Falcon 9 flight of 2025”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX broke one of its launch records on Oct. 22 when a Falcon 9 carrying 28 Starlink satellites lifted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base at 10:16 a.m. EDT. The flight was the 133rd Falcon 9 mission of 2025, breaking the previous record, and the company's 138th overall mission of 2025, tying its 2024 record. Booster 1075 was expected to land on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You; the upper stage deployed satellites about an hour later.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The Cliff cannot originate from a massive, evolved stellar population with an extremely high stellar density.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">From first light, JWST spotted mysterious little red dots (LRDs) that were thought to be ancient mature galaxies. An international team reanalyzed Webb's 2022 dataset and proposed an alternate hypothesis: LRDs resembled stars but were powered by a supermassive black hole core. They focused on one, the Cliff, about 11.9 billion light‑years away; spectral energy distribution suggested an enormous cold star‑like object with a thick atmosphere possibly produced by a shrouded accreting black hole. They ruled out a dense evolved stellar population for the Cliff.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This is the first human data and the results are limited solely to demonstrating the safety of the procedure and not its effectiveness.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers who won the 2024 Ig Nobel investigated enteral ventilation via anus (EVA). Inspired by loaches and prior perfluorocarbon work, Cincinnati Children’s researchers administered oxygen gas or oxygenated perfluorocarbon enemas to mice and micro‑pigs, which staved off respiratory failure without major complications. They then gave non‑oxygenated perfluorodecalin enemas to 27 healthy Japanese men (20 completed), causing only mild transient bloating; the study demonstrated tolerability but not efficacy, prompting further oxygen‑delivery trials.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">JUPITER PROBE SOAKED IN ALIEN DUST</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We have virtually no data on the interior of interstellar comets.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Europa Clipper spacecraft was predicted to be showered by charged particles stripped from the ion tail of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, based on two European researchers' code that identified spacecraft–tail–Sun alignments. The event was harmless to the probe but offered a rare chance to sample interstellar-comet material and compare it with solar-system comets. The alignment was expected between Oct. 30 and Nov. 6, but a U.S. government shutdown threatened to keep the probe's instruments inactive during its cruise phase.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;The possibilities of sedaDNA are immense: it is one to watch.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists used sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA) to reconstruct past environments. DNA from skin, hair, faeces, urine, pollen and decaying tissue had bound to soil and mineral structures and persisted for hundreds of thousands to millions of years. SedaDNA revealed woolly mammoths persisted longer in the Arctic, recorded soft-bodied organisms such as worms, matched ancient Norwegian cave paintings, and featured in the PortGEN analysis of sediments from ancient ports including Rome and Venice to probe past human life.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MOAI WALKED, STUDY SUGGESTS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Once the moai are in motion, it's not at all difficult,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers re-evaluated how Rapa Nui’s moai were moved, reporting evidence they were transported upright by “walking.” A 2012 experiment had propped a 4.35‑ton replica and made it walk using opposing rope teams; Lipo’s team surveyed 962 statues (62 roadside), published a paper showing D‑shaped bases, forward lean, and 4.5 m concave roads optimized walking. They moved a replica 100 m in 40 minutes with 18 people. Distribution (51.6% within 2 km) suggested transport failures; oral traditions also described statues walking.</p>
