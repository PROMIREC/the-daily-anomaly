  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;supernova inside a planetary nebula&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 1572 Tycho Brahe documented a bright new star; a new analysis of recent observations suggested Tycho's supernova had exploded inside a planetary nebula (a SNIP). Evidence included opposing “ears” on the remnant resembling Kepler, SNR G299-2.9 and SNR G1.9+0.3, which supported a core-degenerate scenario in which a white dwarf merged into a companion's envelope. Authors argued SNIPs might have comprised 70–90% of normal Type Ia supernovae, confirming a 1985 suggestion.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Storm surge was the No. 1 cause of the damages and deaths from hurricanes.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article reported that hurricanes were the most destructive U.S. natural hazards, causing over US$1.5 trillion in damage and more than 7,000 deaths since 1980, and that storm surge was the primary cause. It explained storm surge and wave setup, emphasized the need for accurate forecasts for evacuations, described physics-based hydrodynamic models using environmental and bathymetric inputs, and noted that high-resolution, neighborhood-level simulations could take hours, motivating AI-driven speed improvements.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The presence of these simple molecules indicates that radiation could induce similar reactions on Enceladus.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">New laboratory experiments simulated Enceladus's surface ice (water, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia) cooled to −200°C and bombarded with water ions. The radiation produced carbon monoxide, cyanate, ammonium, various alcohols and amino-acid precursors such as formamide, acetylene and acetaldehyde. The team presented results at EPSC‑DPS 2025 and published in Planetary and Space Science. The study suggested some organics Cassini detected in 2005–2015 plumes could have formed by radiation near the surface, complicating links to a habitable ocean.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the LLM’s accuracy at recognizing sources with minimal guidance rather than task-specific training was remarkable.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers tested Google’s LLM Gemini on three sky-survey datasets (Pan-STARRS, MeerLICHT, ATLAS), providing 15 labeled image examples and prompts to classify items as “No interest”, “Low interest”, or “High interest”. A six-month follow-up with an updated Gemini found accuracies of 91.9%, 93.4%, and 94.1% for ATLAS, MeerLICHT, and Pan-STARRS, respectively. Authors said scaling this approach could transform survey processing.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“By avoiding the risks inherent in capture or docking, the [ALBATOR] project aims to provide a safer and more versatile solution to one of the greatest challenges facing space…”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A 3.9 million Euro early-stage project called ALBATOR examined non-kinetic removal of space debris by using ECR-based multicharged ion beams to push junk from a distance without contact. Funded by a European Commission business agency in September, the 3.5-year effort ran until February 2029 and was coordinated by French startup Osmos X with universities in Spain and Germany and NorthStar Luxembourg participating. The project cited ESA estimates of up to 140 million debris pieces as small as 1 mm.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">COMET LEMMON DANCES PAST SKY SERPENT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The lower the number, the brighter the object!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) passed through the stars of Serpens Caput on Oct. 26 before a close approach to the sun in early November. Discovered Jan. 3, it brightened as solar heating vaporized ices, producing a coma and a tail shaped by the solar wind. Observers reported it near magnitude +4.3 (COBS), making it visible to the unaided eye from dark sites low on the western horizon beneath Serpens Caput; by Oct. 27 it moved toward Ophiuchus. Binoculars or a telescope improved views.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">GALACTIC EMPIRES HIDING IN CORE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists had long asked “Where is Everybody?” and debated Fermi’s Paradox. Hart and Tipler assumed inevitable expansion and enduring colonies, estimating 650,000–2 million years to colonize the galaxy and concluding extraterrestrials must not exist. Critics cited colonization difficulties and General Relativity limits. Reiss and Feng argued relativistic expansion could still produce a Type II civilization at the galactic core, which could explain our silence; Sagan countered that absence of evidence was not evidence of absence.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a new way of seeing”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Electronic implants were restoring sight for people with age‑related macular degeneration in European trials, including at Moorfields. A 4mm-square, 30-micrometre-thick retinal microchip converted camera images beamed by infrared into electrical signals; after one year 84% of 38 patients could read letters and numbers, with average improvement of about five lines on an eye chart. Trials reported 26 adverse events, including retinal damage; regulators were reviewing the Prima device and accessibility remained a concern.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">LACERTA LIZARD HIDES ABOVE LONDON</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“reminiscent of a lizard crawling across the sky”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described Lacerta as a faint northern constellation named in the 17th century by Johannes Hevelius, situated between Cygnus, Cassiopeia and Andromeda. It traced a distinctive zigzag reminiscent of a lizard, required a dark sky well away from street lights to see, and was shown as viewed from London at 19:30 GMT on 27 October. It hugged the northern horizon and was challenging to spot, while dark skies also revealed Cygnus and the autumn Milky Way.</p>
