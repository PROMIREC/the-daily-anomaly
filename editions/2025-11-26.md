  <h3 class="hed">LLMS MISTAKE PATTERNS FOR FACTS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This is a byproduct of how we train models.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An MIT study found that large language models sometimes learned grammatical patterns instead of domain knowledge, leading them to link sentence patterns to topics and produce convincing but incorrect answers. Experiments showed even the most powerful LLMs exhibited this failure, which could undermine reliability in customer service, clinical-note summarization, and financial reporting and enable adversarial misuse. The researchers developed a benchmarking procedure to assess and help mitigate models’ reliance on these incorrect correlations before deployment.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“brains also go through these eras”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists identified five major epochs of human brain development from nearly 4,000 brain scans of people aged under one to 90. They found four turning points at about ages 9, 32, 66 and 83, delineating childhood (birth–9), adolescence (to ~32), an adult era beginning in the early 30s that lasted over three decades, early ageing (~66) and late ageing (~83). Using 12 measures of organisation they reported network consolidation in infancy, synaptic pruning, decreased wiring efficiency, rapid grey/white-matter growth, peak cortical thickness and stabilised folding.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ELECTRIC SHIELDS BACKFIRE, DUST CLINGS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“decreasing the charge on the spacecraft is by far the most effective way to lower (but not eliminate) long-term dust accumulation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Lunar dust had been highly adhesive and hazardous, and researchers modeled how low-velocity particles stuck to spacecraft. They distinguished hypervelocity (&gt;1 km/s) from low-velocity dust and combined long-range electric attraction from the vehicle’s charged plasma sheath with short-range adhesion governed by interface energy using Thornton’s adhesive-elastic-plastic model. They found advanced coatings offered limited benefit because the sheath recaptured particles; reducing spacecraft charge was most effective, via passive or active means like electron/ion guns and plasma contactors.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">PROF CLAIMS POSSIBLE DARK MATTER EVIDENCE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““This could be a crucial breakthrough in unraveling the nature of dark matter.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Prof Tomonori Totani analysed NASA’s Fermi Gamma‑ray Space Telescope data and reported a pattern of gamma rays from the Milky Way centre that matched the shape of a dark‑matter halo. He said the signal closely matched predictions for gamma rays from annihilating wimps and could represent the first direct evidence of dark matter, though the study noted more work was needed to rule out less exotic explanations. Results were published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Nature made ferns for pure leaves, to show what she could do in that line.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article by Assistant Professor Jacob S. Suissa described how study of fern stems and vascular anatomy revealed aspects of evolution. It noted ferns' iconic fronds but emphasized stems and roots, referenced their 400 million years of history, and explained developmental constraints as linked traits that could limit or generate new forms. Suissa's research examined the fern vascular system and argued that changes in one part could produce changes in another. It referenced Cuvier's 'correlation of parts.'</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MOONS SHRINK, OCEANS BOIL</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“water will boil”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Nature Astronomy study modelled ice-covered oceans and argued that cyclical tidal heating had melted and refroze interiors; because liquid water was ~10% denser than ice the bodies shrank as they melted, producing low pressure beneath their ice shells. For larger moons gravity either kept the interface liquid or caused shell collapse; for smaller moons the pressure dropped enough that the ocean surface boiled at temperatures just above freezing.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">COLLIDER REVEALS QUANTUM MAGIC</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It is treating the process of colliding things together and forming new particles as a quantum processor.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Physicists used top–antitop pairs produced at the LHC to probe quantum information. Top quarks decayed before hadronizing, so their decay products recorded spin entanglement; ATLAS measured spin correlations in 2023. CMS later measured a pair’s “magic,” a property that made the states hard to simulate classically and could fuel quantum algorithms. Researchers described colliders as emergent quantum processors.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We want to make sure Roman will withstand our harshest environments.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA’s nearly complete Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope passed multiple launch‑simulation tests. The outer observatory underwent an acoustic test up to 138 decibels and vibration testing on a shaker table across 5–50 Hz in three axes, while sensors recorded responses for analysis. The core telescope and instruments completed a 65‑day thermal‑vacuum test in NASA’s Space Environment Simulator, run continuously by a team of over 200, marking the first integrated use of the telescope and instruments. Roman was described as addressing dark energy, exoplanets, and astrophysics.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">PERSEVERANCE SPOTS POSSIBLE METEORITE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“sculpted, high-standing”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA's Perseverance rover spotted a possible iron‑nickel meteorite nicknamed 'Phippsaksla' on Sept. 2 (Sol 1612). It was imaged with the left Mastcam‑Z and analyzed by SuperCam, which indicated an iron‑nickel composition; the rock measured about 31 inches (81 cm). The potential find was reported in a Nov. 13 NASA blog by Candice Bedford and was located on Jezero crater's rim at a site dubbed Vernodden. If confirmed, it would have been Perseverance's first meteorite; earlier rovers had found similar iron‑nickel meteorites.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““The [liquid] water is Clark Kent when it goes down...Then it gets heated, and when it comes up, it’s Superman.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Startup Mazama Energy planned to tap Newberry Volcano’s superhot rock to produce geothermal power. The U.S. had produced roughly 0.4% of electricity from geothermal and operated plants in seven states. Mazama aimed to inject water into dry rock above about 705°F to create supercritical fluid that yielded 5–10× more energy; it targeted 15 MW near term and up to 200 MW, with theoretical site potential about 5 GW. A model found 20% of U.S. land had superhot potential. Risks included induced earthquakes.</p>

  <p class="dek">GLOBE Observer, part of NASA’s NESEC, expanded its satellite-comparison emails to include land cover as well as cloud observations. Built on the NASA Langley cloud system, weekly emails pulled GLOBE data and presented volunteers’ observations alongside satellite-based land-cover assessments and recent Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. The comparisons aimed to connect learners to NASA science, motivate continued citizen-science observations, and show how local measurements fit a broader space-based view.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“A general model does not only mean that we can address more tasks.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers announced BoltzGen, released Oct. 26 and presented by PhD student Hannes Stärk, a generative AI that went beyond Boltz-2 by producing novel protein binders ready for drug discovery. It unified protein design and structure prediction, incorporated wetlab-informed physical and chemical constraints, and underwent rigorous validation on 26 targets — including dissimilar “undruggable” cases — across eight wetlabs. Industry collaborator Parabilis Medicines endorsed its potential, and the open-source release may prompt biotech and pharma to reassess offerings.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“If this is correct, to the extent of my knowledge, it would mark the first time humanity has 'seen' dark matter.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In a study led by Tomonori Totani, researchers analyzed Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope data and reported halolike 20 GeV gamma-ray structures toward the Milky Way center whose spatial distribution matched a dark-matter halo. The observed spectra were consistent with annihilation of WIMPs of roughly 500 proton masses and were said not to be easily explained by conventional astrophysical sources. If independently verified, the detection would have represented the first direct observation of dark matter; further confirmation was needed.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;morels, chicken of the woods, and chanterelles are most common.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">During the COVID-19 pandemic a researcher and Eric Burkhart initiated a yearslong study of wild mushroom harvesting in Pennsylvania and the US mid-Atlantic. Surveys in 2022–2023 found harvesters collected a wide variety of fungi—most commonly morels, chicken of the woods, and chanterelles—and used them mainly for food and medicinal purposes. Foragers formed knowledge-sharing communities using clubs, festivals, social media and DNA data. The findings were published in Economic Botany in October 2025.</p>

  <p class="dek">Uber and Chinese AV operator WeRide deployed fully driverless robotaxis in the United Arab Emirates, initially restricted to Yas Island, where UberX or Uber Comfort riders could be matched if within the service area. The WeRide GXR, based on Geely’s Farizon SuperVan, seated up to five and had over 20 sensors and cameras. Uber oversaw fleet operations with Tawasul Transport; WeRide handled testing and sensor calibration. They planned expansion and launches in 15 more cities over five years.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This November, the 40,000 target was crossed.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Humanity's catalogue of near‑Earth asteroids reached 40,000 in November, rising from about 1,000 in 2000 as surveys accelerated discoveries (10,000 in the past three years). New facilities such as Vera C. Rubin and ESA Flyeye aided detection. Near‑Earth asteroids were defined as objects passing within ~45 million kilometres of Earth's orbit. Nearly 2,000 had non‑zero 100‑year impact probabilities but most were tiny; ~1‑km objects were mostly found while only ~30% of 100–300 m objects were known. ESA's Hera was en route to Dimorphos to study DART.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The ELVE was generated by a powerful negative lightning strike in a storm in Vernazza about 300 km south of me.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Photographer Valter Binotto captured an elve — a rare, rapidly expanding disk-shaped upper-atmospheric lightning — above northern Italy on Nov. 17 from Possagno. He recorded a red ring in a 25 fps video frame using a Sony A7S with a 20 mm f/1.8 lens at ISO 51,200. Spaceweather.com reported the elve was caused by a −303 kiloampere negative lightning strike near Vernazza (~300 km south), occurred about 100 miles above Earth and spanned roughly 200 miles. Binotto had photographed another elve on March 23, 2023.</p>

  <p class="dek">SpainSat NG II was launched on 24 October, completing the ESA‑supported SpainSat Next Generation programme after SpainSat NG I had launched nine months earlier. With both Eurostar Neo satellites (~6 tonnes) now in orbit, Europe gained its most advanced secure‑communications system, with X‑band and KaGov‑band steerable antennas developed under Pacis 3. They were built in five years by Airbus Defence and Space with Spanish industry contribution, and were set to begin joint operations in 2026 to serve Spanish, allied and EU users.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“approximately 250 new gravitational wave signals”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration completed its fourth observation run (O4) in May 2023–this month after more than two years, detecting approximately 250 new gravitational-wave signals, over two thirds of the roughly 350 discoveries to date. Improved sensitivity enabled farther and fainter detections. Notable O4 results included GW250114 confirming Hawking’s area theorem, GW241011 and GW241110 identified as second-generation merger remnants, and GW231123 producing a final black hole exceeding 225 solar masses; hundreds more events awaited cataloguing and upgrades were planned for 2026.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It's instead boiling very close to zero degrees C”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers found that small icy moons could have subsurface oceans that boiled when their ice shells thinned. Maxwell Rudolph's team modeled thinning (by about 3–9 miles/5–15 km) and found pressure drops could reach water's triple point, producing low-temperature boiling near the ice–ocean interface on moons like Mimas, Enceladus and Miranda. They noted a Mimas ocean likely formed within about 10 million years. Larger moons (&gt;370 miles/600 km) would crack instead, as on Titania.</p>

  <p class="dek">China’s Shenzhou-22 spacecraft launched on November 25 and reached and docked with the Tiangong space station, restoring an emergency return vehicle for the crew. Shenzhou-21 had lacked a lifeboat since November 11 because Shenzhou-20’s crew used their craft to return after cracks were found in its window on November 5. Shenzhou-22 flew uncrewed with supplies early (it had been planned for April–May 2026) and would return next year after the six-month crew stint.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researcher Tomomichi Fujita sent hundreds of moss sporophytes to the International Space Station in March 2022; they remained fully exposed on the exterior for 283 days and returned in January 2023. Over 80% of spores survived, about 89% of those germinated, and chlorophyll largely remained normal despite a 20% reduction in one compound. Ground tests showed sporophytes were ~1,000-times more UV-tolerant than other moss parts. A model estimated survival up to ~5,600 days (~15 years), pending more data.</p>

It was an emergency rescue mission for three astronauts who had been stranded ten days after a cracked window—likely from debris—made Shenzhou 20's return craft unfit. The Shenzhou 20 crew returned in Shenzhou 21 on Nov. 14, which left Shenzhou 21 without a safe emergency return, so China launched the backup capsule from Jiuquan 20 days after the damage.</p>
