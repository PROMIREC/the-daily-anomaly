  <blockquote class="quote">“The CTBTO’s worldwide network of infrasound sensors is designed to detect minute disturbances in the atmosphere, including signals from even”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Sandia Labs scientists demonstrated that the CTBTO’s global infrasound sensor network could be adapted for planetary defense to determine when and where objects would impact. The method was described as useful against discarded tools, defunct satellites, space junk, falling meteors, and potentially objects launched in a future space war. The sensors were said to detect minute atmospheric disturbances over thousands of kilometers and were highly sensitive by design.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Radiation directionality acted like a &#39;magical eraser&#39;...”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Chinese physicists experimentally demonstrated a bilayer nanostructure (“metagrating”) that could select a specific light mode from a continuous spectrum, filtering by both wavelength and direction with extreme accuracy. Published in eLight, the team from Sun Yat-sen University and Fudan University achieved unprecedented spatio-spectral selectivity that they said overcame dispersion limits. The advance was expected to improve AR/VR displays, thermal emitters, biosensing and quantum photonics.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“In these individuals, known as hyperthymesics, memories are carefully indexed by date.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described a Paris Brain Institute case study of autobiographical hypermnesia (hyperthymesia). It explained that hyperthymesics precisely indexed memories by date and experienced autonoetic consciousness, citing Valentina La Corte. It noted that while prior reports framed hyperthymesia as emotionally intense and hard to manage, the 17-year-old subject (TL) in this study showed a more controlled, organized form of the condition.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Avi Loeb and Shaun Fell were two of the foremost minds in astrophysics and gravitational research.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Applied Physics (AP) added Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb and theorist Dr. Shaun Fell to lead a new effort aimed at advancing gravity-science applications for planetary defense, advanced propulsion and warp-drive detection, The Debrief reported April 1, 2025. AP had previously published theoretical warp papers, including a constant-velocity warp drive that required no exotic matter, employed over 30 researchers and developed the Warp Factory simulation toolkit. The project’s internal name…</p>

  <p class="dek">A fully digital twin of the Mcity autonomous-vehicle test facility at the University of Michigan was made available for developers to download. Funded by a $5.1 million National Science Foundation grant, the virtual environment included multiple driving scenarios and controllable conditions, enabling large-scale testing without using the Ann Arbor facility. Development began in 2022; the physical Mcity proving ground dated to 2015 and was described as the world’s first purpose-built…</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“regularly spaced dust streaks”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Rui Ni and collaborators at Johns Hopkins, NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center and the University of Michigan had investigated since 2021 an Apollo-era phenomenon: regularly spaced dust streaks radiating from lunar landings observed during the 1960s–70s and on Firefly’s Blue Ghost. Their paper described the fluid dynamics by which the lunar vacuum produced the pattern and framed the result as important for safer, sustained lunar touchdowns.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“resilience, efficiency, and security of U.S. space‑based communications architectures”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The U.S. Space Force, with the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, prepared to launch the eighth X-37B Test Vehicle (OTV-8) carrying next‑generation communications lasers and a quantum inertial sensor. The mission was slated to reach orbit on a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Kennedy Space Center on Aug. 21, 2025. The payload aimed to demonstrate in‑space laser communications and provide navigation in GPS‑denied environments, part of efforts by the Space Force,…</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a cosmic ribbon of plasma twisting through deep space”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">High-resolution images from the Spektr-R satellite, captured by a Heidelberg University-led team, revealed a massive plasma jet—described as a cosmic ribbon—at the core of blazar OJ 287. The images supported the interpretation that OJ 287’s variable brightness arose from two merging supermassive black holes and provided unprecedented views of the blazar’s central jet structure; multi-epoch 43 GHz VLBI observations from 2014–2017 were cited.</p>
