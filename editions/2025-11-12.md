  <blockquote class="quote">“they found nothing at all.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">When the James Webb Space Telescope detected potential biosignatures on sub-Neptune K2-18 b, researchers used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to search 2–10 GHz radio emission from the host star over twelve weeks. They found no steady or burst radio signals, supporting earlier X‑ray faintness and implying a quiet star that likely caused minimal atmospheric erosion (previous estimates ~3% lifetime mass loss). Observations were limited to brief ten‑minute snapshots, so rare flares could have been missed.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Every single subframe I take (prior to stacking) now contains at least one, and usually more than one satellite streak.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Photos of Comet Lemmon (C/2026 A6) were often crossed by satellite streaks as it moved through a Northern Hemisphere sky crowded with orbiting craft. Some photographers removed streaks via stacking and post-processing, while others intentionally revealed the many satellites, mostly Starlink, that traversed their fields. Astrophotographer Dan Bartlett said clean single exposures were nearly impossible and that every subframe contained satellite streaks. About 13,000 satellites were operational (≈8,900 Starlink) and SpaceX had plans for up to 42,000; editing tools permitted trail removal.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“A major breakthrough has been the maturity of Gallium Nitride (GaN) semiconductor devices.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Thales Alenia Space (TAS) developed an essential building block for next‑generation phased‑array antennas under ESA’s Technology Development Element programme, presented by TAS expert Benoit Lejay. Phased arrays steered signals electronically, enabled multi‑satellite links and faster pointing. Rising congestion in Ku/Ka bands drove work into the Q/V‑band for greater bandwidth. Aldo Paraboni on Alphasat first used Q/V commercial links over Europe; subsequent Q/V payloads offered high throughput. Gallium Nitride devices enabled compact high‑power transmitters, but integrating hundreds millimetres apart remained challenging.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“you'll need to be quick to spot the elusive planets before they slip quickly out of sight.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Observers were advised to look low on the southwestern horizon at sunset on Nov. 12 to see Mercury about 5° above the horizon with Mars 1° to its upper right. The pair was hard to spot in sunset glare and set less than an hour after the sun, so viewers were told to be quick and avoid pointing optics near the sun until it was safely below. Mercury displayed retrograde motion and neared solar conjunction on Nov. 20; Mars faced conjunction in January 2026.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“no technical showstoppers for flying to the International Space Station with a prosthesis”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">John McFall — Paralympian, medical doctor and member of ESA’s Astronaut Reserve — was featured in an ESA Explores episode about the FLY initiative. He presented a feasibility study that found no technical showstoppers for flying to the International Space Station with a prosthesis, and discussed next steps: hardware certification, scientific proposals, reserve training and running in microgravity. The miniseries documented Astronaut Reserve Training at EAC near Cologne, covering spacecraft systems, robotics, human behaviour, scientific lessons, scuba and survival training. Interview recorded February 2025.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Join Paxi on a journey through time!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A multimedia presentation invited audiences to join Paxi on a journey through time and explained how humans began exploring space, why European countries formed the European Space Agency (ESA), what ESA did at the time, and how children could take part in the adventure. The item appeared in multiple languages, including English, Czech, Danish and Dutch.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;magnetic fields change everything.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 2023 gravitational-wave detectors recorded GW231123, a merger 7 billion light-years away whose component black holes lay in the pair-instability mass gap (≈70–140 solar masses) and spun near light speed, violating expectations. Ore Gottlieb and colleagues simulated a 250-solar-mass star collapsing to ~150 Msun and found magnetic fields in the accretion disk ejected up to half the mass at relativistic speeds, lowering final black-hole mass and spin. The model predicted associated gamma-ray bursts.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“what if the best place to scale artificial intelligence isn't on Earth at all, but in space?”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google's Project Suncatcher envisioned constellations of solar-powered satellites with onboard processors and laser optical links in Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit to power AI by tapping abundant solar energy. The team proposed tens-of-terabits-per-second inter-satellite links using dense wavelength division and spatial multiplexing (a bench demo reached 1.6 Tb/s), found tight (sub-kilometre) formations required modest station-keeping in simulations, showed TPUs tolerated higher radiation than expected, and modelled ~$200/kg launch-cost targets for viability.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Surprisingly, our modelling showed that an uplink is feasible.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Technology Sydney developed a method for Earth-to-space quantum light transmissions (an uplink) that produced entangled light particles, a capability previously achieved only in space-to-ground links. Their Physical Review Research paper modelled two single photons sent from separate ground stations to meet at a 500 km satellite and undergo quantum interference, accounting for background light, lunar reflections, atmospheric effects, and imperfect alignment. They proposed drone/balloon tests and low-Earth-orbit trials to enable ultra-secure satellite communications and a quantum internet.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“between 15,000 and 23,000 impacts per year”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Moon had no atmosphere and faced a constant micrometeoroid bombardment up to 70 km/s. As NASA's Artemis prepared for a permanent base, Daniel Yahalomi's analysis using the Meteoroid Engineering Model estimated an ISS-sized lunar base would have experienced 15,000–23,000 impacts per year from particles of 10^-6 to 10 g; even one-microgram grains could crater metal. Impact rates varied by location (poles lowest, highest near the sub‑Earth longitude, ~1.6× range). The team modelled aluminium Whipple shields and provided relations linking shield specs, location, and penetration risk.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STAR CELLS REWIRE DOWN SYNDROME MICE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“could reverse changes to neural circuits”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers delivered a connection-building protein to astrocytes in mice and found this intervention could reverse neural circuit changes seen in Down syndrome, according to new Cell Reports research. Down syndrome arose from trisomy 21 and caused neurodevelopmental and other impairments. Astrocytes secreted proteins important for forming neuronal connections; mouse models showed reduced levels of some astrocyte proteins, so the team tested whether restoring those proteins could rewire the brain.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The parachute system deployed as planned and the sequence was executed flawlessly.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">India tested the Gaganyaan astronaut capsule parachute system on Nov. 3 by dropping a 7.2-ton mass simulator from an Indian Air Force IL-76 over Babina Field Firing Range at about 1.6 miles. ISRO said the 10‑chute system (cover removers, two drogues, three pilots and three mains) was stressed under asymmetric disreefing; two mains deployed and yielded a stable descent and soft landing, validating the design toward human-flight qualification.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Our plan will support work to end animal testing wherever possible.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">UK science minister Patrick Vallance unveiled a roadmap to phase out animal testing by accelerating use of AI, organ-on-a-chip systems and 3D bioprinted human tissues, backed by new funding and streamlined regulation. The strategy said alternatives must match safety for human exposure and set timelines: end regulatory skin and eye irritation and skin sensitisation tests by end-2026, stop mouse botox strength tests by 2027, and reduce dog and primate pharmacokinetic studies by 2030.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">METEOR TRIGGERS MARS BARCODE AVALANCHE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Meteoroid impacts and quakes seem to be locally distinct, yet globally relatively insignificant drivers,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Christmas Eve 2023 ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter imaged barcode-like dark streaks on Apollinaris Mons produced by a meteoroid-triggered dust avalanche. A study led by Valentin Bickel analyzed over 2 million slope streaks in 90,000 orbital images (2006–2024) using a deep-learning scan of MRO/CTX data and found fewer than one in 1,000 streaks resulted from impacts. Most formed seasonally during southern summer and autumn winds, and collectively moved about a quarter of Mars' annual surface–atmosphere dust exchange.</p>
