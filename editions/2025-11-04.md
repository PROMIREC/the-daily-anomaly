  <blockquote class="quote">“We encounter these larger meteors about twice a decade at irregular intervals.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Southern Taurid meteor shower peaked overnight on Nov. 4–5, 2025, as Earth passed through the outer edge of a debris swarm from comet 2P/Encke. 2025 was a swarm year and could have produced up to about 10 bright meteors per hour and notable fireballs from baseball- to basketball-sized fragments, though a near‑full moon reduced visibility to the brightest events. Observers were advised to watch after midnight toward Taurus and allow 30 minutes for dark adaptation.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;It's not the cow, it's the how.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Johnnie Balfour farmed a 300-strong Aberdeen Angus herd near Glenrothes, planned to expand, and ran a carbon-negative business that removed more CO2 than it emitted. He used year-round mob grazing, moving cattle onto fresh grass daily, and said emissions from the herd were offset by trees, soils and grass. Balfour argued farm management (feed production, fertiliser, machinery) drove emissions and called cutting livestock numbers a simplistic response.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We need randomised clinical trials to prove cause and effect”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that modest daily walking slowed Alzheimer’s progression in a 14-year study of 296 initially cognitively unimpaired 50–90-year-olds. Pedometer-measured step counts and PET imaging showed 3,000–5,000 steps/day delayed cognitive decline by about three years and 5,000–7,000 steps/day by about seven years; higher baseline amyloid carried greater risk, but among those people more steps were linked to slower cognitive decline and delayed tau buildup. Authors said reverse causation could not be excluded and called for randomised trials.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Annular substructures can emerge as early as the Class 0 stage but are often hidden by optically thick emission.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using ALMA, the FAUST team imaged 16 Class 0/1 protostellar disks and found evidence that planet formation may start earlier than previously thought. The study, led by Dr. Maria Jose Maureira Pinochet and published in Astronomy and Astrophysics, identified one known and one candidate substructure; surveys had shown only five clear substructures (all Class I). The authors concluded that annular features could emerge by Class 0 but were often hidden by optically thick ∼1 mm emission.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“has the potential to accelerate particles to PeV energies”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers described how supernova blast waves interacting with complex circumstellar material (CSM) produced much stronger signals than in smooth-wind models. Brose et al. modeled blast waves hitting dense, multilayered CSM shells and predicted enhanced gamma-ray and multiwavelength emission that could peak years after explosion and persist long-term. For some remnants (Type IIP and Type IIn) luminosities could exceed smooth-wind predictions by orders of magnitude. The study, 'Interacting supernovae and where to find them,' was to appear in Astronomy and Astrophysics and was on arXiv.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“about 100 trillion neutrinos pass through you every single second”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described that cosmic voids lacked matter but were not empty: neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and a low-level radiation bath pervaded them. Cosmic rays and neutrinos originated from energetic astrophysical events, crossed voids over tens of millions of years, and produced few detectable hits (about one cosmic ray per second and ~100 trillion neutrinos per second passing through a person but only one lifetime interaction). The cosmic microwave background dominated universal radiation, having free-streamed since recombination at 380,000 years.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Physics-based methods are universal.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT engineers developed a physics-based tool that predicted how lightning would sweep across aircraft of any design and produced zoning maps showing regions requiring various levels of lightning protection. They addressed uncertainties for novel configurations (blended-wing bodies, truss-braced wings) because existing protections were designed for tube-and-wing aircraft. The IEEE Access study named Nathanael Jenkins first author; co-authors included Louisa Michael and Benjamin Westin (Boeing); prior work by Sam Austin predicted initial attachment points.</p>

  <p class="dek">Waymo announced it would launch robotaxi services in Detroit, Las Vegas and San Diego. Detroit would be mapped before public service and residents were told they would &quot;soon&quot; see Waymo vehicles; San Diego had &quot;plans to begin serving the city next year.&quot; Las Vegas service would include the Strip with plans to expand to the airport. Waymo already operated in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Francisco, Atlanta and Austin, had expansions or plans for Miami, Washington, DC and London, and partnered with DoorDash for Phoenix deliveries.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“often requiring users to annotate as few as 25 examples”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An Oregon State study estimated over 3,500 animal species were at risk. MIT PhD student Justin Kay (CSAIL) worked on tracking Pacific Northwest salmon and, with CSAIL and UMass Amherst colleagues, developed CODA (consensus-driven active model selection) to choose among millions of pre-trained AI models. CODA made data annotation active and guided users to label the most informative examples, often needing as few as 25 annotations. Their ICCV Highlight Paper was supported by NSF, NSERC, and J-WAFS.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“You have to look at the needs of the application and design methods in a way that actually fulfills those needs.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed FSNet, a machine-learning–based tool that incorporated a feasibility-seeking step to iteratively refine model predictions until they met system constraints. It solved complex optimization problems — such as power-grid scheduling — several times faster than traditional solvers, provided strong guarantees of feasibility, sometimes found better solutions for extremely hard cases, and outperformed pure ML approaches that could not always produce feasible solutions.</p>

  <p class="dek">Hektoria Glacier retreated by more than 8 km in two months in late 2022 and about 25 km between January 2022 and March 2023. A new study claimed it could be the first modern case of a glacier front on the seabed rapidly destabilising, which could imply faster sea-level rise if it happened elsewhere. Other scientists said the section had been floating as an ice shelf, so the changes were less unusual. Lead author Naomi Ochwat called the causes a 'whodunnit.'</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Early galaxies were more turbulent, less stable, and grew up through bursts of star formation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A study led by Lola Dunhaive used JWST NIRCam to observe 272 small galaxies from 800 million to 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang and found they were turbulent, chaotic systems. Ionized hydrogen flowed in multiple directions with eddies, shocks and clumps rather than smooth rotation; intense gas infall, bursty massive star formation and active supermassive black holes drove instability as galaxies progressed through a 'dawn of disks' before settling into modern cold disks.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Keck’s critical contribution was to make direct images of this Brown Dwarf companion which led to characterizing the object’s orbit and physical properties such as mass and…”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Brown dwarfs were substellar objects of 13–80 Jupiter masses, first predicted in the 1960s and confirmed in the mid‑1990s. An international team led by Taichi Uyama discovered a brown dwarf, J1446B, about 55 light‑years away orbiting red dwarf J1446 as a binary companion. Using Keck (NIRC2 AO), Subaru (IRD) and Gaia astrometry, they determined J1446B’s mass (~60 Jupiter), orbit (4.3 AU, ~20 years) and ~30% near‑IR brightness variability, implying atmospheric phenomena. Results were published 20 Oct in The Astronomical Journal.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Latvia’s accession to the Artemis Accords is a significant step towards our more active participation in the global space community.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Latvia became the 60th nation to commit to the NASA-led Artemis Accords, the country announced at the end of October. Latvia was the fourth country to join in October, doubling 2025 signatories; October additions also included the Philippines, Malaysia and Hungary, after earlier 2025 signings by Senegal, Norway, Bangladesh and Finland. The Artemis Accords, established in 2020 and marking five years in October, set international principles for peaceful lunar and deep-space exploration and were not directly tied to NASA's Artemis missions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“analogs varied in setting, length and intensity.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Conversation article explained how scientists used Earth-based &quot;analogs&quot; to simulate space conditions to prepare for human spaceflight. Researchers selected extreme environments and habitats to replicate lunar or Martian elements, testing crew performance, procedures and instruments, and training analog astronauts. The piece described practical challenges such as performing tasks in thick gloves and suits and noted analog missions varied in setting, length and intensity — from transit simulations to surface operations lasting up to a year.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">HEAT EXPOSES SUPERPOSITION AND ENTANGLEMENT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“anomalous heat flow”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Alexssandre de Oliveira Jr. proposed that quantum-induced 'anomalous' heat flow—heat transfer exceeding classical limits when a quantum system was coupled to an information-storage system and a heat sink—could serve as a noninvasive thermometer for 'quantumness.' By measuring excess heating of the sink, observers could detect superposition or entanglement without destroying them; the effect sacrificed stored information for heat. The work linked quantum versions of the second law to information and suggested uses in verifying quantum computers or probing quantum gravity.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“you could use one tool irrespective of where you are on the aggressiveness scale”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The £1.9m, three-year Vanguard Path study, funded by Prostate Cancer UK and led by University of Oxford researchers, tested the ArteraAI Prostate Biopsy Assay on more than 4,000 digitised biopsy samples. The AI produced personalised risk scores and had previously identified men likely to benefit from abiraterone; US trials suggested wider uses. The study first evaluated archived UK samples, then piloted the tool at three NHS sites to compare clinicians' treatment choices and timing.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Manifolds transformed how mathematicians think about space.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Standing in a field, people could forget Earth’s curvature; many shapes looked locally flat though globally complex. Mathematicians called those shapes manifolds. Introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century, manifolds changed how mathematicians treated space, enabled rigorous study of higher-dimensional spaces, spawned modern topology, and became central across geometry, dynamical systems, data analysis and physics.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Our approach harnesses the tumor’s own machinery to produce immune-stimulating molecules.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers stimulated cancer cells to produce a molecule that activated the cGAS-STING pathway in nearby immune cells by delivering mRNA to tumors. In mice, activating that pathway controlled tumor growth and worked better when combined with checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy. The mRNA strategy aimed to harness tumor machinery to produce cGAMP locally, potentially avoiding toxic high doses of STING agonists and easing patient translation. The paper, led by Alexander Cryer with senior author Natalie Artzi, appeared in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“has been the realisation that seasonal changes in human mood are probably endogenous – that they’re part of our physiology”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers tracked large cohorts and identified how sleep, light and therapy affected people whose mood declined with winter. SAD had been formalised in the 1980s and was defined as a seasonal subtype of major depression or bipolar disorder, with symptoms beginning in autumn or winter. Large datasets (UK Biobank) revealed endogenous seasonal mood changes linked to reduced daylight disrupting circadian timing. Symptoms included longer sleep, lethargy and increased carbohydrate craving; subsyndromal winter blues affected ~20%, full SAD ~2%.</p>
