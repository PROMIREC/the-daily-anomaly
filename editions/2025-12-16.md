  <h3 class="hed">URANUS AND NEPTUNE MAY BE ROCKS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The ice giant classification is oversimplified, as Uranus and Neptune are still poorly understood.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Zurich and NCCR PlanetS developed an agnostic interior-modeling method using random density profiles and gravity calculations constrained by observations and found that Uranus and Neptune could have rock-dominated interiors rather than primarily water 'ices'. Their models allowed interior convection, produced ionic-water layers that could generate non-dipolar magnetic fields (with Uranus' field arising deeper), and matched other findings; they said current data were insufficient and recommended dedicated missions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The EVAs fully demonstrated the critical role of human capabilities in extravehicular operations, with the suits providing robust safety assurance for astronauts.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Chinese taikonauts tested new D and E spacesuits on Dec. 9 during EVAs aboard the Tiangong station, worn by Shenzhou-21 crew Zhang Lu and Wu Fei. The suits were second-generation EVA adaptations of Feitian IVA suits, adding radiation, thermal, micrometeorite and UV protection, liquid cooling and a backpack life-support system. Delivered July 15 by Tianzhou-9, the suits had a 20-EVA/4-year lifespan; tasks included installing debris shields, inspecting a damaged Shenzhou-20 porthole, and replacing thermal insulation.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ANTIMATTER RARE MIRROR, DARK MATTER LURKS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“When matter and antimatter met, they destroyed each other in a flash of light and energy.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article explained that dark matter and antimatter were completely different: antimatter was the well-understood mirror twin of ordinary atoms with opposite electric charges (positrons for electrons, antiprotons for protons) and was very rare, while dark matter was abundant but invisible and unidentified. When matter and antimatter met they annihilated into light and energy. Some ordinary atoms, such as potassium in bananas, could decay and produce tiny amounts of antimatter.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">TWENTY YEARS OF PETABYTE POWER</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The true achievement was not technological but human.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) had been created to handle LHC data and had become a global network linking hundreds of computing centres in more than 40 countries. It had enabled thousands of scientists to store, process and analyse hundreds of petabytes of data in quasi‑real time. A CERN Science Gateway event on 8 December marked the community’s achievements; early leader Les Robertson and Academia Sinica’s evolution into a regional Tier‑1 hub were highlighted.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SATELLITES EXPOSE GLOBAL METHANE GIANTS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This is the first global gridded estimate of annual methane emissions from facility-scale measurements.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using high-resolution observations from the GHGSat satellite constellation, researchers produced a global, facility-level view of methane emissions, identifying 3,114 oil, gas and coal sites that emitted about 9 million tons per year. The study, led by Dylan Jervis and published Dec. 11 in Science, noted meter-scale resolution with global coverage, found largest oil/gas emitters in Turkmenistan, the U.S., Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan and largest coal emitters in China and Russia, and reported poor agreement with inventories at 0.2° grid scales.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SUN'S SPIKY ESCAPE BOUNDARY MAPPED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Before, we could only estimate the sun's boundary from far away”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists mapped for the first time the Alfvén surface, the sun's shifting 'point of no return' where solar wind exceeded magnetic-wave speeds and particles escaped permanently. Using Parker Solar Probe close passes plus ESA's Solar Orbiter and NASA's Wind, they found the boundary became larger, rougher and more jagged during solar maximum. Published Dec. 11 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the maps were said to help improve space-weather models and predictions for other stars' atmospheres.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ROBOTS BUILD CHAIRS ON COMMAND</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Sooner or later, we want to be able to communicate and talk to a robot and AI system the same way we talk to each other to make things together.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at MIT and collaborators developed an AI-driven robotic assembly system that let users build physical objects by describing them in natural language. One generative model produced 3D geometry from a prompt and a second determined component placement by function and geometry; a robot then assembled prefabricated parts and iterated with user feedback. The team fabricated chairs and shelves from two component types, enabling disassembly and reducing waste; a user study found over 90% preference for their objects.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ANCIENT OCEANS OXYGENATED RAPIDLY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“ocean oxygenation appears to have followed atmospheric oxygen surprisingly quickly”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Nature Communications study led by Andy Heard (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) analyzed vanadium isotope ratios in 2.32–2.26 Ga Transvaal Supergroup shales and reported a unidirectional transition in global ocean redox conditions shortly above the stratigraphic level marking the canonical rise of atmospheric O2. The authors concluded that surface ocean oxygenation followed atmospheric oxygenation relatively quickly during the Great Oxidation Event (~2.4 Ga), which facilitated aerobic respiration and bore on exoplanet habitability interpretations.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">INTERSTELLAR COMET SWEEPS PAST EARTH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth or any other planets.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on Dec. 19. Discovered July 1 by NASA-funded ATLAS telescopes in Chile, it was the third confirmed interstellar object after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its trajectory showed it originated beyond the solar system and would return to interstellar space. At closest approach it came about 1.8 AU (≈168 million miles/270 million km) from Earth, posed no danger, and afforded researchers opportunities to study released dust and gases; Hubble and JUICE imaged it and a livestream was offered.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The river’s brown waters at its mouth result from massive amounts of silt, clay, and organic matter carried from upstream regions of the Mekong River Basin.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A camera on the International Space Station captured an Oct. 2, 2025 photo of the Bassac River around Cù Lao Dung, a river-islet district in southern Vietnam. The Bassac surrounded the district before emptying into the South China Sea. Its brown waters at the mouth resulted from silt, clay, and organic matter carried from upstream in the Mekong River Basin, combined with tidal forces that stirred up sediment. The photograph was taken as the station orbited 260 miles above Earth.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MIT CRACKS PROTON CONDUCTION CODE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“you can tune those traits to improve the speed of that process”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed a physical model that predicted proton mobility across a wide range of metal oxides, ranked the most important material features for proton conduction, and for the first time quantified how oxide-ion flexibility enhanced proton transfer. They suggested using these quantitative relations to screen material databases or guide design (including generative AI) to improve devices that use protons, noting implications for fuel cells, electrolyzers, proton batteries, and low-energy neuromorphic electronics. The paper appeared in Matter.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">EVENING FIRES CHOKE NORTHERN PLAINS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Farmers have changed their behavior.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Every year from October to December farmers in northern India burned post-harvest rice stubble, producing smoke and haze across the Indo-Gangetic Plain that raised pollution well above WHO limits; in late 2025 pollution exceeded AQI 400 and prompted school closures. NASA scientist Hiren Jethva found that while the seasonal timing followed typical patterns, fires shifted later in the day—from about 1–2 p.m. historically to 4–6 p.m.—so MODIS/VIIRS often missed them; GEO-KOMPSAT-2A showed 2025 burning was moderate versus recent years.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">RADIO SIGNAL PREDICTS AURORA STORMS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Auroral substorms are caused by the accumulation and then release of magnetic energy stored in Earth's magnetosphere during its interaction with the solar wind flow.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Southampton analyzed ground-based observatories in Finnish Lapland, imaging satellites, and radio antennae on NASA's Polar and Japan's Arase missions and identified a distinct auroral kilometric radiation burst that appeared as auroral beads formed and intensified at substorm onset. The radio fine structures indicated small-scale electric potential structures along magnetic field lines and suggested a possible universal magnetospheric mechanism, though the exact trigger remained partly unresolved.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Roman’s ability to observe wide areas of the sky to great depths, spotting an abundance of faint and distant galaxies, will revolutionize the study of cosmic voids.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope was expected to measure cosmic voids with new precision, enabling tests of the universe’s expansion and dark energy. Researchers projected that a Roman High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey design would detect tens of thousands of voids, some as small as 20 million light-years across. Astronomers planned to derive 3D void shapes from galaxy positions and spectroscopic redshifts, converting redshift to distance under assumptions about matter and dark energy.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FLY NEURONS EDIT RNAS EXTENSIVELY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““We have this ‘alphabet’ now for RNA editing in these neurons.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers surveyed RNA editing across more than 200 individual tonic and phasic fruit‑fly motor neurons and found hundreds of edits in transcripts from hundreds of genes. Most sites were edited at intermediate, widely varying rates rather than all-or-nothing. They reported 316 canonical ADAR edits in 210 genes (175 in coding regions; about 60 likely altered amino acids), 141 noncoding regulatory edits, many non‑canonical edits, juvenile‑specific edits in larvae, and previously uncataloged targets; data were published in eLife.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It still has the potential to tilt our winter toward the dry side in the American Southwest.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A weak La Niña had emerged in the equatorial Pacific in late 2025, returning in September and persisting into December. NOAA's December 11 report confirmed below-average sea surface temperatures likely to continue for another month or two. Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich data (Dec. 1, 2025) showed below-normal sea levels in the central and eastern Pacific; Sentinel-6B launched in November 2025 and was expected to contribute to ENSO research in 2026. Scientists said weak events made specific weather impacts difficult to predict.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It’s like training a dog.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">HyprLabs was a 17-person startup, led by Zoox cofounder Tim Kentley‑Klay, that for about 18 months ran two modified Tesla Model 3s—each with five extra cameras and a palm-sized supercomputer—around San Francisco to test how quickly autonomous-vehicle software could be built. The company had raised $5.5 million since 2022, publicly introduced a training-focused product called Hyprdrive, and said its technique departed from camera-only and multi-sensor approaches while showing a promising signal that needed scaling.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“there’s no distinction between memory, the memorizer and the act of remembering.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Carlos Arrojo reflected on Quanta’s 2025 biology coverage, highlighting Claire L. Evans’s exploration of aneural (brainless) cellular memory, which recounted experiments testing whether individual cells recorded environmental experiences and challenged neuroscience concepts. He also praised Peter Brannen’s geologic climate modeling that spanned 540 million years, integrated fossil and genomic evidence, and traced how pioneering forests, coal swamps and plankton shaped Earth’s carbon cycle and planetary evolution.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“NASA planned to release the solicitation near the beginning of calendar year 2026.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA sought industry-led architecture concept development, concept refinement, and risk-reduction studies under NextSTEP-3 Appendix B to address Moon-to-Mars Architecture gaps and planned to release the solicitation near the beginning of calendar year 2026. The recurring, flexible program invited several calls per year for proposals on infrastructure, transportation, habitation, concepts of operations, and planetary science per the Architecture Definition Document. Initial directed calls targeted an evolving lunar surface power grid and Mars crew transportation, including in-space transit, surface access, and ascent options.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“first observational evidence that these monster stars existed”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers reported first evidence of primordial “monster” stars up to about 10,000 solar masses, inferred from an anomalous nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio (0.46) in galaxy GS 3073, 12.7 billion light-years away and seen 1.1 billion years after the Big Bang. Models of 1,000–10,000 solar-mass stars showed core helium produced carbon that leaked into hydrogen-burning shells to create nitrogen, which convection expelled, explaining the chemical signature and potential seeding of early supermassive black holes. They lived about 250,000 years.</p>
