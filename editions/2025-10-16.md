  <blockquote class="quote">“It’s like having an iPhone 42 rather than an iPhone 17.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An astrophysicist proposed a “radical mundanity” hypothesis to explain the Fermi paradox: the Milky Way hosted a modest number of civilisations whose technology was only marginally ahead of humanity’s. Having explored nearby systems with imperfect probes, they reportedly became bored and stopped long-lived signalling or expansion, making technosignatures scarce. Dr Robin Corbet’s paper was yet to be peer reviewed and warned contact might disappoint.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SOLAR SAILS TURN REENTRY SHIELDS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Shape Shifting Sailer (3S)”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Auburn engineers Joseph Ivarson and Davide Guzzetti proposed the Shape Shifting Sailer (3S), a thin solar sail that was to be reconfigured with shape‑memory alloy hinges into a cone‑like heat shield/drag device for aerobraking and atmospheric entry. They modeled a design‑space and feasibility study and used a genetic algorithm to trade off peak temperature versus peak pressure; ‘leaf’ shapes minimized pressure while ‘cannonball’ shapes minimized temperature. Case studies (Earth, Mars, Titan, Uranus, Neptune) showed ~20–25% heating reduction at Earth and up to ~40% at Mars, but the concept was infeasible for the gas giants.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a single three day eruption could deposit ice layers up to five metres thick on the Martian surface”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Between 4.1 and 3 billion years ago Mars had widespread volcanism. A team led by Saira Hamid used climate modelling to simulate eruptions and showed volcanic water vapour froze into ice crystals that fell back, with a single three-day eruption able to deposit up to five metres of ice. Rapid burial by volcanic debris or prolonged sulphur-driven winters could have preserved equatorial ice, with Syrtis Major and Apollinaris Mons linked to elevated hydrogen signatures and potential resources for future missions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Using STV as a novel solubilizing agent”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists reported that stevioside (STV), a natural sweetener from Stevia, was used as a solubilizing agent to formulate a dissolving microneedle patch delivering minoxidil, improving solubility, bioavailability, and skin penetration. In mouse models of androgenetic alopecia, the patch produced hair regrowth in 67% of treated areas versus 25% in controls over 35 days. The study appeared in Advanced Healthcare Materials and authors said human clinical trials were needed.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FALSE CLAIMS TREATED AS VICTORY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“consider it a 'win' to lean in to known falsehoods”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers published in the Journal of Social Psychology reported that some people treated endorsing easily disproved COVID-19 claims as a symbolic “win.” They surveyed 5,535 people across eight countries during the pandemic and found the strongest predictor of belief in COVID-19 misinformation and perceived vaccine risks was viewing prevention efforts in terms of symbolic strength versus weakness. That motive outweighed feelings about COVID-19, cognitive style and political beliefs.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Simulating such processes is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of relativistic plasmas in curved spacetimes near compact objects, which are governed by the…”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Most galaxies hosted supermassive black holes, producing active galactic nuclei. In 2019 the Event Horizon Telescope imaged M87’s SMBH, whose jet had been first observed by Heber Doust Curtis a century earlier. A Goethe University team developed the FPIC code that combined the Blandford–Znajek mechanism with magnetic reconnection to simulate how rotating SMBHs converted spin and magnetic energy into jets. Simulations on German supercomputers reproduced jets from M87’s ~6.5-billion-solar-mass black hole that extended thousands of light-years and influenced the intergalactic medium and galaxy evolution.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AI PINPOINTS PERSONAL ITEMS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Ultimately, we want these models to be able to learn from context, just like humans do.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at MIT and the MIT‑IBM Watson AI Lab introduced a training method that taught vision‑language models to localize personalized objects. They used video‑tracking datasets that tracked the same object across frames and were designed to force contextual reasoning rather than memorization. Models retrained with a few example images located personalized objects better, outperformed state‑of‑the‑art systems, and retained their general abilities; applications included tracking belongings, ecological monitoring, and assistive tech.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">YEAST SURVIVES MARTIAN BLAST</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“yeast doesn't just survive these conditions, it even has sophisticated molecular strategies for coping with them.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers exposed Saccharomyces cerevisiae to simulated Martian shock waves (5.6 Mach) and sodium perchlorate concentrations and found the yeast survived by assembling ribonucleoprotein condensates (stress granules and P-bodies). Shock-like impact induced both stress granules and P-bodies, perchlorate induced P-bodies only, and simultaneous exposure reduced growth but did not kill cells. Mutants unable to form condensates performed poorly, and transcript-level disruptions were mapped. The study concluded these condensates were active survival mechanisms under Mars-like stresses.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">LANTERN SHEET SNAPS INTO SPINNING TOP</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““This basic shape is, by itself, bistable.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Engineers at North Carolina State University developed a thin‑polymer ‘Chinese lantern’ structure that transformed between multiple three‑dimensional stable shapes and stored and rapidly released elastic energy, as reported in Nature Materials. A diamond‑shaped sheet with evenly spaced slits folded into a hollow lantern that snapped into a spinning‑top form; twisting and folding produced up to four stable states. A magnetic film enabled remote actuation; demonstrations included gentle fish grippers, underwater fluid valves and tube reopening. The team produced a mathematical model linking geometry to stored energy.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Before starting math, I thought water waves were something very understood — not a problem at all.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Alberto Maspero’s office overlooked Trieste’s bay, where the bora wind sometimes reversed waves so they streamed away from the city yet dispersed before reaching the open sea. The article explained that Euler’s equations, written nearly 300 years ago, described ideal fluid flow and contained solutions for phenomena like tsunamis, but were usually impossible to solve. For decades steady wave solutions were inferred from observation and guesswork; Maspero, Massimiliano Berti and colleagues were leading efforts to prove major conjectures.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FEW HAIL FALSE CLAIMS AS VICTORY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Following coronavirus prevention guidelines means you have backed down.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers published in the Journal of Social Psychology reported a survey of 5,535 people across eight countries during the pandemic and found that the strongest predictor of endorsing COVID-19 misinformation was viewing prevention efforts as symbolic displays of strength or weakness. This mindset, which outweighed general attitudes, thinking style, and politics, led people to prioritize psychological independence and treat endorsing disprovable claims as a “win.” A separate crypto study showed similar links to conspiracy beliefs; most participants did not hold this mindset.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“What do you think would look better: pink or green?”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Rob Schmitz reported in NPR's Far‑Flung Postcards that on an August day he joined scientists from ETH Zurich on the Rhône Glacier in the Swiss Alps. The team poured bubblegum‑pink dye into a melting glacial rivulet as a visual aid while measuring accelerating meltwater flow; they heard running water from beneath the ice, navigated dozens of massive cracks (packing lists advised carrying an Eispickel) and photographed the temporarily pink stream.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SPINNING PULSARS HEAR COSMIC BEATS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“If two such systems have very similar frequencies, their waves can interfere and create a beat pattern”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers used pulsar timing arrays to search for a gravitational-wave background and in 2023 NANOGrav and partner experiments reported evidence suggesting such a background. Physicists Hideki Asada and Shun Yamamoto proposed that nearby supermassive black‑hole binaries with similar nanohertz frequencies could interfere to produce beat patterns in pulsar timing. Detecting these beats would have disentangled supermassive‑black‑hole signals from primordial inflationary waves and helped estimate binary populations and masses.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">WAYMO TO LAUNCH LONDON ROBOTAXIS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;a defining moment for UK autonomy.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Waymo planned to bring fully autonomous taxis to the UK in 2026, marking its first major expansion outside the US. It selected Moove as its fleet operations partner and sought UK approvals to launch a London robotaxi service as the Automated Vehicles Act 2024 began enabling pilots from Spring 2026. Waymo said its technology reduced the risk of injury-causing collisions; the RNIB welcomed the move. Waymo already had UK engineering hubs and a Jaguar Land Rover partnership, while Uber and Wayve planned rival pilots.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Andromeda is easily visible to the naked eye from a dark sky location.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Late October was ideal to spot the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), 2.5 million light-years away in Andromeda. It rose in the east at sunset, climbed overhead by midnight and moved northwest by dawn. Its spiral arms spanned 260,000 light-years and contained over a trillion stars orbiting a supermassive black hole. Andromeda appeared to the naked eye as a hazy oval; telescopes revealed its glowing core. Observers used Cassiopeia's 'M' and Shedar to find it; one astrophotographer logged 38 hours and smartphone adapters enabled impressive images.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“AVT uniquely combines vehicle and driver data.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A decade-plus collaboration between MIT’s AgeLab and Toyota’s Collaborative Safety Research Center and AVT Consortium collected and analyzed large naturalistic driving datasets, informed Toyota’s vehicle design and driver-assistance and automated systems, and supported Toyota’s 100th CSRC project. AVT drew over 25 organizations to study technologies such as lane-centering and adaptive cruise control; pedestrian-driver interaction research influenced Toyota’s e-Palette at the Tokyo Olympics and an ISO automated-driving communication best practice.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“high-throughput and plug-and-play”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed an approach to detach cells from surfaces on demand using electrochemically generated bubbles. They published an open-access paper in Science Advances and demonstrated a lab prototype that worked across a range of cells and surfaces without harming cells. The method aimed to reduce waste and downtime caused by cell sticking in bioreactors, pharmaceutical cell culture, biofuel production, biosensors, implants, and food-and-beverage processes, and was presented as scalable and plug-and-play.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DARK MATTER LEAVES COLOR FINGERPRINTS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“it could still have a kind of colour signature.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">University of York researchers proposed in a Physics Letters B paper that light traversing dark-matter-rich regions could have acquired faint red or blue tints, depending on dark-matter properties. They argued indirect interactions via intermediate particles (e.g., the Higgs) could cause tiny photon scattering and polarization &quot;fingerprints.&quot; If dark matter were WIMPs, transmitted light would be slightly reddened; if it interacted only gravitationally, it would be faintly blueshifted; detection required next-generation telescopes.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">CHARRED STARSHIP SPLASHES INTO INDIAN OCEAN</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Flight Test 11 was a complete success.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX's Starship Flight Test 11 lifted off Oct. 13 from Starbase and, according to new video, splashed down intact in the Indian Ocean after a successful mission. The 397-foot vehicle—the final launch of that configuration—achieved all goals: booster descent and Gulf splashdown, Ship splashdown, deployment of eight simulated Starlink satellites, and an in-space Raptor relight. Flight 11 showed less damage and heat-shield discoloration than Flight 10 and used altered engine burns to prepare for a taller variant.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I’m incredibly grateful and honored to be awarded a Packard Fellowship.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT affiliates Darcy McRose and Mehtaab Sawhney were named 2025 Packard Fellows for Science and Engineering, one of 20 early-career researchers awarded an unrestricted $875,000 research grant over five years. McRose, a Cabot Career Development Assistant Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering, researched how microbial secondary metabolites in soil shaped plant microbiomes, nutrient cycling, and soil fertility using genetics, chemistry and geosciences. She had joined MIT in 2022 and previously trained at Stanford, Princeton and Caltech. Sawhney (MIT Math ’20, PhD ’24) was at Columbia.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“As my daughter got sicker and sicker, our quest for answers dragged on.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Guardian podcast examined why long-term effects of Lyme disease were controversial. It noted celebrities (Bella Hadid, Justin Bieber, Miranda Hart) had described years-long struggles, and that despite rising rates and greater awareness the illness remained poorly understood. Madeleine Finlay interviewed Guardian reporter Patrick Barkham about his daughter Milly’s experience and Prof John Aucott of Johns Hopkins about long-term impact.</p>
