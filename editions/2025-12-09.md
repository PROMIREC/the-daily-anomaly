  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;first-ever X-ray detections of chlorine and potassium&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A study by the XRISM spacecraft made the first-ever X-ray detections of chlorine and potassium in the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant; the paper was published Dec. 4, 2025, in Nature Astronomy. A Jan. 8, 2024 image combined X-ray, visible, and infrared data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Hubble, Webb, and Spitzer space telescopes to show Cas A’s emission.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Searches for IMBHs in GCs can involve direct detection of emission from the IMBH, or the indirect observation of the impact of the IMBH on GC dynamics,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">IMBHs were intermediate between stellar and supermassive black holes but lacked convincing evidence. Omega Centauri (OC), a dense 10-million-star globular cluster ~17,000 ly away and likely the remnant core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, was a leading IMBH candidate. A 2024 Hubble study measured 1.4 million stellar velocities and found seven central stars exceeding escape velocity, implying a central IMBH. JWST MIRI/NIRCam 2024 data (Chen et al., submitted to ApJ) showed no accretion signatures of an isolated IMBH; prior mass estimates ranged 8,200–47,000 solar masses.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the surface of ice was coated by a thin watery layer”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists explained that ice surfaces were coated by a thin, liquidlike layer that made them slippery, but they disagreed about why the layer formed. Three main theories had been debated; German researchers proposed a fourth earlier in 2025, but no consensus had been reached. In the mid-1800s James Thomson had proposed pressure melting (confirmed by Lord Kelvin), while in the 1930s Bowden and Hughes argued pressure was insufficient and attributed slipperiness to frictional melting, supported by experiments in a Swiss ice cave.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“One of these environments was the S cluster, which consisted of two distinct populations: the main-sequence S stars, and the dusty G objects.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An article reported that researchers used two decades of VLT SINFONI and NACO observations plus new ERIS data to track S‑stars and dusty G‑objects near Sagittarius A*. They used Keplerian fits to predict positions and tested whether G2/DSO, D9, X7 and a YSO X3 matched those predictions, reassessed G2's elongation, and evaluated whether the Galactic‑center environment was as destructive as previously thought.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Each rocket launch sends tonnes of valuable materials into space that are never recovered.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers led by Zhilin Yang assessed applying reduce–reuse–recycle principles to satellites and spacecraft. They said spaceflight was wasteful: propellant made most launch mass and launches emitted greenhouse gases and ozone‑depleting chemicals; satellite disposal and expendable rockets produced orbital debris. They reported 7,070 launches and about 15,100 metric tons of LEO objects, warned of Kessler‑effect cascading risk, and urged a shift to a circular space economy with repairable, refuelable systems and advances in materials science and AI.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Often we don’t only care about what will happen, but when the target event will happen.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers, collaborating with the PETAL consortium at Massachusetts General Hospital, identified a prognostic marker showing that aggressive T‑cell lymphoma patients who relapsed within 12 months of initial therapy had dramatically worse survival. Using data from thousands worldwide and a causal inference framework called Synthetic Survival Controls (developed in Jessy Han’s thesis), the finding held across subgroups and prognostic scores. The study suggested clinicians could prioritize targeted therapies or early‑phase trials for high‑risk patients. The research was published in Blood.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“landed for the 32nd time”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage Booster 1067 set a record by landing for the 32nd time after launching 29 Starlink satellites on Dec. 8 from Kennedy Space Center, following a weather delay. The first stage separated after 2.5 minutes and landed on droneship Just Read the Instructions; the upper stage coasted and fired again to deploy Group 6‑92 an hour later. The flight raised Starlink to over 9,100 satellites and was SpaceX's 158th Falcon 9 launch of the year and 510th first‑stage reflight since 2017.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DOG DNA TESTS DEBUNKED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Genetic tests for behavioral and personality traits in dogs are now being marketed to pet owners, but their predictive accuracy has not been validated.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers led by Kathryn Lord compared DNA sequences and behavioral surveys from 3,287 dogs in the Darwin’s Ark project and tested 151 SNPs. They found no reliable associations between simple genetic variants and traits such as aggression, drive, or affection, contradicting claims by popular at-home tests. The team said behavior was largely polygenic and heavily shaped by environment, that genomic predictions would need vastly larger samples, and that misuse could affect adoption or care decisions.</p>

  <p class="dek">Branelle Rodriguez was the Artemis II vehicle manager for NASA’s Orion Program and oversaw the spacecraft’s preparation for the Artemis II lunar mission. Based at Johnson Space Center, she managed Orion’s hardware integration and flight readiness, directed the spacecraft’s move to Kennedy’s Vehicle Assembly Building and its mating with the SLS rocket, and had been involved in development, testing and launch readiness. Her 21-year NASA career included life‑support work, ISS anomaly leadership, joined Orion in 2022, and a persistent path from internships to full-time engineer.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Roman will carry out a technology demonstration to test coronagraph systems.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using Japan’s Subaru Telescope atop Mauna Kea, astronomers in Hawaii reported the first OASIS discoveries: an exoplanet, HIP 54515 b, and a brown dwarf, HIP 71618 B. OASIS used Subaru plus Hipparcos and Gaia data to identify stars being tugged by unseen companions. HIP 54515 b was 271 light‑years away, about 18 times Jupiter’s mass and orbited at a Neptune-like distance; HIP 71618 B was 169 light‑years away and was identified as a Roman Space Telescope test candidate.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““These observations allow us to watch a stellar explosion in real time.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Authors reported early high-resolution imaging of two 2021 gamma-ray novae, V1674 Her and V1405 Cas, and concluded that nova ejections were complex. They explained that accreting white dwarfs in binaries heated gathered hydrogen until runaway fusion expelled most envelopes; some cases became Type Ia supernovae but most did not. V1674 Her showed rapid, perpendicular multiple outflows 2–3 days after eruption that created internal shocks and GeV gamma-rays. V1405 Cas exhibited delayed bulk ejection ~50 days later, triggering new shocks and further gamma-rays.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BLACK HOLE BELCHES 60,000 KM/S WINDS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We’ve not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">XMM-Newton and XRISM observed a bright X-ray flare from the supermassive black hole in NGC 3783, after which ultra-fast winds formed within a day, reaching about 60,000 km/s (≈ one-fifth the speed of light). The 30-million-Sun black hole powered an active galactic nucleus, and researchers attributed the rapid wind launch to a sudden 'untwisting' of the AGN’s magnetic field, analogous to solar coronal mass ejections. The team noted such winds influenced host-galaxy evolution and star formation.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">PARACHUTE DRAMA: KIM, CREW HOME</h3>
  
  <p class="dek">NASA astronaut Jonny Kim returned to Earth with Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky after an eight-month (245-day) mission aboard Soyuz MS-27. They departed the ISS on Dec. 8 at 8:41 p.m. and landed under parachute at 12:03 a.m. EST southeast of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, after 3,920 orbits (nearly 104 million miles). Kim and Zubritsky flew their first missions; Ryzhikov logged his third (603 total days). Kim conducted bioprinted tissue, Surface Avatar robotic, and DNA-mimetic nanomaterial experiments. The crew went to Karaganda; Kim was flown to Houston.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">PROMISING EARTHLIKE PLANET MAY BE AIRLESS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the previously reported tentative hint of an atmosphere is more likely to be 'noise' from the host star”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">New JWST observations and follow-up simulations revisited TRAPPIST-1e, an Earth-size planet in its star's habitable zone. Early NIRSpec transits had hinted at methane, but transit-to-transit variations suggested stellar contamination. Ranjan and colleagues modeled methane photochemistry and found methane around TRAPPIST-1e would be destroyed far faster than on Titan—lasting roughly 200,000 years versus 10–100 million—too short for plausible geological replenishment, so the methane hint was likely stellar noise though an atmosphere was not ruled out.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““It’s really important for us to pay attention to non-neuronal cells’ role in health and disease.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers led by Guoping Feng produced an open-access atlas documenting astrocyte molecular diversity across space, time, and species. They profiled astrocyte transcriptomes from mice and marmosets at six life stages (embryo to old age) in four brain regions — prefrontal and motor cortices, striatum, and thalamus — revealing regional specialization and developmental shifts; the study appeared in Neuron (Nov. 20) and was supported by the Yang Tan Center and the NIH BRAIN Initiative.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The crew are feeling great.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Two Russian cosmonauts, Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky, and American astronaut Jonny Kim returned to Earth after eight months aboard the International Space Station, landing in snowy Kazakhstan on Dec. 9 aboard Soyuz MS-27. The capsule touched down at 12:03 a.m. EST (0503 GMT) under parachute and braking thrusters; recovery teams from Roscosmos and NASA assisted the crew. Ryzhikov and Kim were in good condition; Zubritsky went to a medical tent. Their undocking on Dec. 8 ended Expedition 73.</p>
