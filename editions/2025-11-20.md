  <blockquote class="quote">“The first paper in this Lancet series indicates that ultra-processed foods harm every major organ system in the human body.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The world’s largest review reported that ultra-processed foods (UPFs) harmed every major organ system and posed a threat to global health. A Lancet series found UPFs displaced fresh food worldwide, accounted for over half of diets in the UK and US and up to 80% in some people, and were linked to higher risks of a dozen conditions including obesity and type 2 diabetes; 92 of 104 long-term studies reported greater chronic disease risk or earlier death. The rise was driven by aggressive corporate tactics.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We showed that X-ray polarimetry can be used to make detailed measurements of the white dwarf's accretion geometry.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Some 200 light years away, MIT astronomers used NASA’s IXPE to observe EX Hydrae, an intermediate polar, and measured a surprisingly high degree and unexpected direction of X-ray polarization. They traced the X-rays to the innermost region near the white dwarf’s surface and identified emission from a white-hot accretion column about 2,000 miles high—roughly half the star’s radius and larger than predicted—and confirmed that X-rays were reflected off the white dwarf’s surface before scattering. The study demonstrated X-ray polarimetry’s diagnostic power.</p>

  <p class="dek">Astronomer Gianluca Masi captured a detailed image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on Nov. 19 as it moved away from the sun after perihelion on Oct. 29. Discovered July 1, 3I/ATLAS was the third known interstellar visitor after 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Masi combined eleven 120-second exposures from a 10-inch astrograph at the Virtual Telescope Project in Manciano, Italy; the images showed a bright nucleus, diffuse coma and a gossamer-like ion tail. NASA also released images collected by multiple missions.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers analyzed splatter paintings by children, adults, and Jackson Pollock through a fractal lens and found children's work resembled Pollock’s more than adults’. Co-author Richard Taylor had first reported fractal patterns in Pollock in 2001, faced criticism in 2006, but later machine‑learning studies (2015, 93%; 2024, 99%) supported fractal distinctions. Other work examined coiling instabilities and whether Pollock deliberately exploited them. Pollock’s technique involved flat canvases, varied tools, viscosity tweaks, and, reportedly, clumsy movement.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Once again, NASA and America are leading the way for the future of flight.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">After years of development, NASA’s X-59 quiet supersonic research aircraft completed its first flight on Oct. 28, taking off at 11:14 a.m. EDT and flying 67 minutes as part of the Quesst mission. Piloted by Nils Larson after a taxi from Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, the aircraft flew subsonic at about 230 mph to roughly 12,000 ft with landing gear down while teams performed system and performance checks. It then landed at Edwards AFB and moved to NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center, beginning flight operations.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Everyone that is in control of a telescope wants to look at it because it’s a fascinating and rare opportunity.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Nasa released close-up pictures of interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, the third confirmed object, after discovery over the summer. Three Nasa spacecraft and two ESA satellites imaged the fuzzy white blob as it passed about 18m miles (29m km) from Mars; ESA’s Juice and other telescopes also observed, though Juice’s data were delayed until February. The comet, estimated 440 m to 5.6 km across, was visible in the predawn sky, approached 167m miles (269m km) to Earth in mid‑December, then departed back to interstellar space.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“These new organic compounds were just minutes old.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reanalyzed Cassini data from a 2009 close plume flyby and found previously undetected organic compounds in ice grains collected 13 miles (21 kilometers) above Enceladus’ south pole. The fresh, minutes-old particles originated from the moon’s subsurface ocean and showed a greater diversity of organics, including molecules that suggested pathways to chemical or biochemical activity. Published in Nature Astronomy, the study indicated that organics seen in Saturn’s E ring were present in Enceladus’ ocean rather than produced by long space exposure.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We look around, and certainly the world seems more complex than that.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Physicists found in 2019 that a mathematically defined universe like ours paradoxically admitted only a single possible quantum state, implying no informational bits despite supporting black holes, stars and observers. They argued the result conflicted with physical expectation and arose from assuming an observer‑free, objective description of an entire universe; if such a description were impossible, the universe’s apparent complexity lost meaning. The discussion invoked AdS holography (Maldacena) and boundary descriptions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“These numbers would have been considered science fiction 10 years ago.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">At CERN’s ALPHA experiment, researchers reported a new positron cooling technique that produced antihydrogen atoms eight times faster. By adding a cloud of laser-cooled beryllium ions for sympathetic cooling in a Penning trap, positron temperatures dropped to about −266 °C, enabling accumulation of over 15,000 antihydrogen atoms in under seven hours. Previously, collecting 16,000 atoms for precision spectroscopy had taken 10 weeks. The advance was expected to permit overnight accumulation and more rapid investigation of atomic antimatter and systematic uncertainties.</p>

  <p class="dek">The bursera plant’s leaves squirted high-pressure liquid resin up to 1.5 metres from canals in the leaf when bitten, a repellent, poisonous secretion that could solidify and entomb small insects. Larger attackers experienced reduced growth and shortened lifespans. Over millions of years some beetles evolved to disarm leaves by nibbling notches for up to an hour before feeding, but they still suffered slow growth and early death.</p>

  <p class="dek">Google announced it was testing Scholar Labs, an AI-powered search that answered detailed research queries by identifying topics and relationships. In a demo about brain–computer interfaces the tool surfaced a 2024 review in Applied Sciences and explained its relevance, but it did not offer filters for citation counts or journal impact factors. Google said Scholar Labs ranked papers by full text, venue, authorship and citation context yet would not limit results by citation or impact metrics; researchers noted those metrics reflected social context.</p>

  <p class="dek">The article argued that although the Lambda-CDM model had been resilient for decades, it was incomplete because the nature of dark energy remained unknown. It traced accelerated expansion to a cosmological constant tied to quantum vacuum (zero-point) energy via Zel’dovich’s insight, but noted naive vacuum-energy calculations exceeded observations by over a hundred orders of magnitude. Recent DESI data showed a tentative (~3.5σ) preference for evolving dark energy over a constant cosmological constant.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“If black holes quantum radiate, then they emit heat energy and have a thermal temperature.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Hawking radiation had not been proved but was widely accepted. The argument said combining event horizons with quantum fuzziness allowed thermal energy to escape; semi-classical models supported it despite no full quantum gravity. If true, black holes were governed by thermodynamics: they emitted heat, had temperature and entropy, and the four laws mapped to black holes—for example, a non-rotating black hole had uniform gravity at its horizon and its temperature and entropy were determined by the horizon's surface area.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“You know, Bertrand Russel published a 500-page book to prove that one plus one equals two.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">DeepMind built AlphaProof, an AI that matched silver-medalist performance at the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad and scored one point short of gold at the most prestigious undergrad math competition. The team said conventional LLMs only “sounded” right and lacked guaranteed correctness, so they used the Lean proof assistant to formalize mathematics. They trained a Gemini model to translate natural-language math into Lean, producing about 80 million formalized statements and exploiting imperfect translations.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“what’s in these planets’ atmospheres holds the next clue”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers first searched for liquid-water planets by identifying a star’s habitable zone, but being within it did not guarantee habitability because geological activity and atmospheric gas regulation mattered. A planet’s atmosphere — and its greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor — was the next clue to whether liquid water and possibly life existed. The authors noted Earth’s atmosphere kept the surface about 33°C warmer than it would have without one, and habitable-zone boundaries were defined by required greenhouse warming.</p>

The system reportedly contained over two billion spiking neurons and 100 billion synapses, ran on about 2,000 watts, and could be among the largest brain-like computers. The team framed it as a step toward advanced brain-like intelligence and potential disease and drug-research applications, though its existence was described as uncertain.</p>

  <p class="dek">JWST had revealed a class of small, highly redshifted early-Universe galaxies called Little Red Dots (LRDs). Initially their nature was unclear, but one hypothesis posited primordial galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), challenging formation theory. New JWST NIRSpec observations identified CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 at about 570 million years after the Big Bang; its spectra showed broad and high-ionization lines, indicating an actively accreting, unusually massive SMBH. The study was led by Roberta Tripodi and published in Nature Communications.</p>
