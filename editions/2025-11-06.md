  <blockquote class="quote">“The Copernicus Sentinel-1D satellite has joined the Sentinel-1 mission in orbit.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Copernicus Sentinel-1D satellite joined the Sentinel-1 mission in orbit after a 4 November 2025 launch at 22:02 CET (18:02 local) aboard an Ariane 6 from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana (flight VA265). Sentinel-1D flew 180° apart from Sentinel-1C to optimise coverage; both carried C-band SAR and AIS instruments. The mission delivered all‑weather, day‑and‑night radar imagery used by disaster responders, environmental and maritime authorities and climate scientists; Sentinel‑1D enabled more frequent AIS observations.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MOON WALTZES WITH SEVEN SISTERS</h3>
  
  <p class="dek">Observers were advised to look west before dawn on Nov. 6 to see a 94%-lit Moon about halfway up the sky with the Pleiades open cluster roughly 5° to its upper left; the cluster could be faint in the Moon’s glare. 10x50 binoculars revealed the seven brightest members (Merope, Electra, Maia, Taygete, Asterope, Alcyone, Celaeno). Uranus lay about 5° lower left of the Pleiades at magnitude +5.6 and appeared as a tiny blue dot through 8-inch or larger telescopes. Celestron NexStar 8SE was recommended.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;I would have moved mountains for him.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Guardian described that a device like the AquaWomb had offered hope for parents of extremely premature infants while posing hard choices. It recounted Beth Schafer’s 23‑week son, who did not survive despite resuscitation, described 2017 animal artificial‑womb experiments with fetal lambs, and reported that in September 2023 the FDA convened an advisory committee to consider human trials for babies born at 22–24 weeks. Over 10,000 US infants were born in those gestational boundaries and premature birth remained the second‑leading cause of infant death.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We could push the boundary beyond what we knew about the brain.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at UCSF and the Allen Institute, led by Reza Abbasi‑Asl, built Cell Transformer — a transformer AI they trained on millions of mouse‑brain data points. It produced a high‑resolution map revealing roughly 1,300 distinct brain regions and subregions — over 25 times the ~52 regions in traditional atlases — within hours. The team said the finer parcellation could refine targeting for Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, depression, neural therapies, drugs, and studies of consciousness; findings appeared in Nature Communications in October.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“dust grains block visible light from stars behind them very efficiently but are much less effective at dimming near-infrared light.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA’s Euclid space telescope imaged the dark cloud LDN 1641 in Orion, about 1300 light‑years away. Euclid’s NISP infrared data revealed numerous young stars and magenta-coloured outflows hidden in visible light, and showed background galaxies where dust thinned. Observations in September 2023 tested and validated Euclid’s pointing; 0.64 square degrees were imaged in under five hours. Euclid aimed to map the extragalactic Universe to study dark matter and dark energy.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;GI provides potential performance advantages when integrated with active interrogation such as dose minimization, enhanced Signal-to-Noise Ratios (S/N), and increased standoff…”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">DARPA’s Defense Sciences Office issued an RFI asking researchers to apply ghost imaging—using correlated particles (neutrons, gamma photons, and others) in classical, quantum, or computational variants—to detect hidden nuclear material. The agency said ghost imaging reconstructed images from correlations between a beam that interacted with an object and one that did not, and could enable through-shield standoff detection, improved signal-to-noise, and reduced radiation dose compared with traditional active interrogation methods.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“first publicly available, globally diverse, consent-based human image dataset for evaluating bias across a wide variety of computer vision tasks.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Sony AI released the Fair Human‑Centric Image Benchmark (FHIBE), which it called the first publicly available, globally diverse, consent‑based human image dataset for evaluating bias across a wide variety of computer vision tasks. FHIBE included images of nearly 2,000 paid participants from over 80 countries, all shared with consent and removable, and were annotated for demographics and context. Sony found no existing dataset met its benchmarks; FHIBE confirmed and diagnosed biases across pronoun, ancestry, skin‑tone, hairstyle and occupational stereotypes. The dataset and a Nature paper were published.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Project Suncatcher is a moonshot exploring a new frontier&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google announced Project Suncatcher to study deploying swarms of solar-powered low-Earth-orbit satellites carrying Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and free-space optical links to scale AI compute. Early tests showed TPUs could withstand space radiation, but Google said thermal management and on-orbit reliability remained significant challenges. The company proposed a Sun-synchronous polar &quot;terminator&quot; orbit for continuous sunlight and published a research paper and blog post explaining the effort and the motivation of rising AI energy and cooling demands on Earth.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We’ve shown that it is possible to generate an accurate 3D reconstruction in a matter of seconds with a tool that works out of the box.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed a system that could process an arbitrary number of camera images to produce accurate 3D maps of large, complex scenes in seconds. The method incrementally created and aligned submaps, stitched them into a full reconstruction, and estimated the robot’s pose in real time. It combined modern AI vision and classical computer-vision ideas, required no camera calibration or expert tuning, and was proposed for search-and-rescue, XR, and warehouse use; it was presented at NeurIPS.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“hiding in plain sight”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Since penicillin's discovery, antimicrobial resistance had emerged as a major threat, with WHO warning it could cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050. Scientists from Warwick and Monash discovered pre-methylenomycin C lactone — an intermediate produced by Streptomyces coelicolor — by deleting biosynthetic genes. The intermediate proved far more potent than methylenomycin A against Gram-positive bacteria, notably MRSA and VRE (which showed no resistance under vancomycin-resistance conditions). The compound was headed to pre-clinical trials.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“circulatronics”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed microscopic, wireless bioelectronics that could be injected into the bloodstream, autonomously travel to and self‑implant in targeted brain regions in mice, and be wirelessly powered to deliver focused neuromodulation. Integrated with living cells, the implants crossed the blood‑brain barrier without triggering immune attack or damaging neurons, achieved micrometer‑scale targeting to treat brain inflammation, and avoided surgery‑related risks and costs. The work, termed “circulatronics,” was reported in Nature Biotechnology and led by Deblina Sarkar.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““The miBrain is the only in vitro system that contains all six major cell types that are present in the human brain.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed a 3D human brain tissue platform called Multicellular Integrated Brains (miBrains) that integrated all major brain cell types — including neurons, glia, and vasculature — into a single culture. Grown from individual donors’ induced pluripotent stem cells, miBrains replicated key tissue features, were customizable by gene editing, and were scalable for large studies. In a first application, they showed how a common Alzheimer’s genetic marker altered intercellular interactions; the open‑access study was published Oct. 17 in PNAS.</p>

  <p class="dek">On Nov. 5 at 8:31 p.m. EST a Falcon 9 launched from Cape Canaveral carrying 29 Starlink satellites to LEO. The mission was SpaceX's 141st Falcon 9 liftoff of 2025 and 146th launch of the year; the company had also flown five Starship tests and devoted more than 100 flights this year to Starlink. Booster B1094 flew its fifth mission and landed on the droneship Just Read the Instructions; the upper stage deployed the satellites about an hour into flight, joining over 8,800 Starlink craft.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This 'Arjuna' object has, by definition of a quasi-satellite, an orbital period of a year…resulting in its extended presence close to Earth.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that object Arjuna 2025 PN7, a faint body detected by Pan‑STARRS in 2014 and part of the Arjuna quasi-satellite population, was proposed by Avi Loeb and Adam Hibberd to be a technosignature potentially originating from the Soviet Zond‑1 Venus probe that failed in 1964. Trajectory models and similar brightness matched Zond‑1 timing, though its closer solar approach and lack of spectroscopy made identification uncertain; it could instead be a discarded rocket upper stage.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the universe has already entered a phase of decelerated expansion”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">New research reported that cosmic expansion had begun to slow, contradicting the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model that posited accelerating expansion driven by dark energy. Using 300 galaxies, Yonsei University researchers found that Type Ia supernova brightness depended on progenitor age, producing a 99.99% significance that dimming could arise from stellar effects; after correcting for bias they ruled out LCDM and inferred the universe had transitioned to decelerating expansion, possibly implying dark energy was weakening and evolving rapidly.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“spooky cosmic structure resembling a bat”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Just before Halloween, ESO's VLT Survey Telescope (VST) at Paranal captured an image of a nebula about 10,000 light‑years away that resembled a bat. The stellar nursery spanned an area equivalent to four full Moons between the constellations Circinus and Norma; RCW 94 and RCW 95 formed the bright wings. Bright hydrogen emission from newborn stars and colder, dustier filaments produced the bat-like silhouette. The composite combined VST visible data (VPHAS+) and VISTA infrared (VVV); the VST was operated by INAF with a 268‑MP OmegaCAM.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DARK ENERGY IN DOUBT: UNIVERSE SLOWS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;the universe has already entered a phase of decelerated expansion&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers cast doubt on the Nobel prize–winning claim that cosmic expansion was accelerating, suggesting instead that expansion had been slowing and dark energy was weakening, potentially implying a future 'big crunch.' Led by Prof Young-Wook Lee, they argued that observations of distant type Ia supernovae—previously treated as uniform 'standard candles' and central to the 2011 Nobel-winning discovery—rested on a faulty assumption. The Desi consortium had reached a similar conclusion earlier that year.</p>

  <p class="dek">Quantinuum announced Helios, a trapped-ion chip that raised qubit count from 56 to 96 while maintaining or improving two-qubit gate fidelity. Helios used a single four-way intersection coupling two ion-storage areas and a loop that rotated ions; the system routed ions into legs at the intersection to enable operations as ions sloshed across the chip. The article explained trapped-ion qubits used nuclear spin for long coherence, electromagnetic control to move ions, and that moving ions was relatively slow.</p>

  <p class="dek">AgiBot, a Shanghai humanoid-robotics company, engineered two-armed robots to learn manufacturing tasks via human teleoperation and real-world reinforcement learning and tested the system on Longcheer Technology’s production line. Its software, called Real-World Reinforcement Learning, was reported to train robots in about ten minutes for non-delicate tasks (moving components from testers to the line). AgiBot operated a paid robotic learning center for teleoperators; the work suggested productivity increases and shifts in low-wage factory jobs.</p>

Euclid used its NISP near-infrared detector during a five-hour observation in September 2023 to see through dust—which absorbed visible light and re-emitted infrared—and revealed YSOs, outflows that carved bubbles, and a jet with lumpy structure implying a changing magnetic field. Euclid's primary mission remained a wide 3D map to study dark energy and dark matter.</p>

  <p class="dek">Scientists recreated 'cosmic fireballs' at CERN’s HiRadMat by generating electron–positron pairs in the Super Proton Synchrotron and blasting them through 1 meter of plasma to simulate blazar jets. The Oxford and STFC CLF team aimed to probe jet stability and explain missing low-energy gamma-rays and intergalactic magnetic fields. They tested whether pairs were deflected by weak intergalactic magnetic fields or destabilized by plasma instabilities; in testing those concepts the team obtained enlightening and surprising results.</p>

  <p class="dek">Google proposed Project Suncatcher, which planned to place solar-powered satellites hosting Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in low-Earth orbit to supply continuous clean power and reduce CO2 from AI cloud computing. The paper noted benefits (up to eightfold solar productivity), engineering challenges (radiation, tens-of-terabits-per-second low-latency links) and operational ideas (tight formations). Google estimated comparable cost-efficiency by the mid-2030s and planned a 2027 two-satellite prototype mission with Planet.</p>
