  <blockquote class="quote">“uncover new, life-saving antibiotics”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Cristina Dorador was on an urgent mission in Chile’s Atacama, the world’s highest desert, seeking new antibiotics in the salt flats she had studied since she was 14. As drug-resistant superbugs killed millions annually, her microscopic discoveries led her team to question how lithium mining was damaging the delicate ecosystem and impacting Indigenous communities against the backdrop of the region’s endless plains.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“it’s most likely not a lake”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">New MRO SHARAD radar data, collected after a 120° 'Very Large Roll' to remove spacecraft interference, failed to reproduce the 2018 MARSIS bright subsurface reflection near Mars's south pole that had been interpreted as a briny lake. SHARAD detected subsurface returns only about 0.1% as strong as the surface. Engineers tested attenuation hypotheses and found no mechanism sufficient to hide liquid water, so a subsurface lake was deemed unlikely.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“providing safe, reliable, and cost-effective hardware and software systems NASA needs to maintain temperature-critical science materials”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA selected the University of Alabama at Birmingham to provide systems to return temperature-sensitive science payloads from the Moon. The indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract began Dec. 4, had a 66-month base with two optional periods potentially extending through June 3, 2033, and an estimated value of $37 million. The contractor was tasked with delivering hardware and software to preserve temperature-critical lunar geological, human research and biological samples aboard Artemis spacecraft. Selection followed NASA engineers’ evaluation and source-selection review.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The waxing gibbous phase comes just before the full moon.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A photograph taken from the International Space Station on Oct. 3, 2025, while it orbited 263 miles above a cloudy Atlantic off the coast of Quebec, Canada, showed the waxing gibbous Moon rising above Earth’s blue atmosphere. The text explained that only the Sun produced its own light, which illuminated Earth and reflected off the Moon to create moonlight, and that the waxing gibbous phase came just before the full Moon.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I think the closest instrument today in terms of tone is the french horn.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Archaeologist, musicologist and trumpeter Miquel López García and Margarita Díaz-Andreu reported that 12 large Charonia lampas shells from Neolithic settlements and mines in Catalonia, dated to the late fifth–early fourth millennia BC, had been collected after death and had tips removed, indicating trumpet use. Acoustic experiments on eight intact shells in November 2024 produced a powerful, stable tone likened to a French horn; recordings showed notes and timbral changes via hand occlusion and altered articulations, suggesting communication and musical roles.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Deployment of 29 Starlink satellites confirmed.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Twenty-nine Starlink satellites were launched into low Earth orbit by a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, lifting off Dec. 2 at 5:18 p.m. EST (2218 GMT). The satellites (Group 6-95) were deployed 1 hour 5 minutes after liftoff, SpaceX confirmed. First stage Booster 1077 returned and landed on the drone ship A Shortfall of Gravitas on its 25th flight. The satellites joined over 9,100 operational relays; it was Falcon 9’s 155th flight of 2025.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SOHO SURVIVES NEAR DEATH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the mission has exceeded all expectations.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SOHO launched on 2 December 1995 on a planned two‑year mission and operated from the Sun–Earth L1 point 1.5 million km away. It provided nearly continuous observations over almost three 11‑year solar cycles. The spacecraft suffered a critical spin and loss of contact 2.5 years after launch that required a three‑month recovery, and later gyroscope failures in late 1998 were overcome with new software by February 1999. SOHO revolutionised space‑weather monitoring and sustained high scientific productivity.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MIT FINS SLASH TANKER FUEL COSTS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We document for the first time experimentally a reduction in fuel required by ships using vortex generators”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers demonstrated that wedge-shaped vortex generators attached to ship hulls reduced drag by up to 7.5 percent, lowering fuel use and emissions. Presented at the 2025 SNAME Maritime Convention, the study used AI-guided CFD and rapid-prototyping experiments on scale hulls to identify wedge devices that delayed turbulent separation, shrank wakes, and improved propeller/rudder efficiency. The modular fins could retrofit bulk carriers and tankers, potentially saving $750,000/year on a 300 m Newcastlemax on a cross‑Pacific route. Work was supported by the CBA Consortium and Oldendorff.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">KNOTTED FIELDS COULD BIRTH MATTER</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This mystery is known as the matter asymmetry problem.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described how charge and C, P, T symmetries implied matter–antimatter symmetry but the observed Universe was matter-dominated, creating the matter asymmetry problem. Researchers examined extended Peccei–Quinn (PQ) and B−L symmetries and found they allowed solitonic knot configurations that could decay asymmetrically to produce more matter than antimatter. Such knots could have formed after the Big Bang and left a gravitational-wave signature, though detection exceeded current capabilities; the study was not conclusive.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">CAMBRIAN LARVA'S BRAIN STUNS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“natural fossilization has achieved almost perfect preservation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists reported a 520-million-year-old worm larva fossil with brain and guts almost perfectly preserved. Scans using synchrotron X-ray tomography revealed a brain (including a protocerebrum), digestive glands, a primitive circulatory system and nerves to legs and eyes. The detail showed early arthropods were more complex than previously thought and helped link Cambrian forms to modern arthropods. Researchers called the larva’s preservation extraordinary and said it provided rare developmental data for arthropod evolution.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SCIENTISTS FEED MACHINES FEELINGS, SINGULARITY LOOMS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Consciousness begins not with thought but with need.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers argued that consciousness might arise from bodily needs and primitive feelings rather than high-level cognition. Startups like Conscium tested neuromorphic AIs with homeostatic drives (energy, temperature) that generated simple valence signals—micro-reward, micro-aversion—to guide behavior. These systems mapped their environment and body, prioritized competing needs, and adjusted actions using faint 'good/bad' signals, producing a rudimentary analogue of biological affect. Proponents claimed affective neuroscience suggested emotion-first mechanisms could seed machine awareness, unlike body-less LLMs.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Light quanta from different quantum dots have never been teleported before because it is so challenging.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers from the University of Stuttgart, Saarland University and IFW Dresden published in Nature Communications and successfully transferred quantum information between two photons emitted by different quantum dots. The experiment, seen as a step toward quantum repeaters for a quantum internet, overcame the challenge of creating indistinguishable photons using nearly identical quantum dots and frequency converters; teleportation succeeded about 70 percent of the time, with plans to improve fabrication and fidelity.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The toxic effects of rare-earth mining were devastating, with poisoned rivers, contaminated soil, sickness, and displacement.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In early 2025 a migrant worker traveled to Shan State to work at Chinese-run rare-earth sites in Wa territory, where he was paid about $21 daily to dig boreholes for in situ leaching. Acidic solutions extracted heavy rare earths (dysprosium, terbium) that settled in pools and were burned into oxides. Reporting confirmed that Chinese companies rapidly expanded mining, which contaminated water, caused deforestation, sickness, displacement and livelihoods loss; Myanmar served as a sacrifice zone and lacked public licensing records.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the stereotype that we can tolerate more pain deeply affected the care I received.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A representative survey of 2,200 people by the Migraine Trust found people from ethnic minority backgrounds reported worse migraine care and fear of discrimination. 23% of mixed-ethnicity, 19% of Asian and 16% of Black respondents said ethnicity negatively affected care versus 7% of white respondents. Black respondents were more likely to fear discrimination (37% v 26% white). Nineteen percent of Asian and 14% of Black respondents worried they would not be believed, compared with 8% of white respondents. The charity's chief executive called for action.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“penetrating cracks”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">China's space agency said it would return a damaged Shenzhou 20 spacecraft uncrewed for inspection after a suspected sub‑millimeter debris strike produced penetrating cracks in a viewport, making crewed reentry too risky. Shenzhou 20's crew had delayed departure on Nov. 5 and instead returned to Earth in their relief crew's spacecraft on Nov. 14; a replacement craft launched Nov. 22 to restore a lifeboat for Shenzhou 21. CMSA said the recovered craft would yield data for future missions; Shenzhou 23 was expected April 2026.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“nobody wants to prick their finger every day”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed a shoebox-sized, noninvasive glucose monitor that used Raman spectroscopy to measure blood glucose without needles. In tests on a healthy volunteer, the device’s measurements matched those from commercial continuous glucose monitors that required an implanted wire. The prototype was later miniaturized into a wearable now being tested in a small clinical study. The study appeared in Analytical Chemistry and was led by postdoc Arianna Bresci with senior author Jeon Woong Kang.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We want future vehicles to be more versatile”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A team from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory took three research drones to Death Valley National Park and the Mojave Desert to test navigation software called Extended Robust Aerial Autonomy. The campaign, one of 25 Mars Exploration Program projects funded that year, aimed to address navigation issues like those that affected Ingenuity over featureless dunes. Tests at Mars Hill and Mesquite Flats produced findings on camera filters and landing algorithms; teams worked in temperatures up to 113°F under the park's third-ever research drone license.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The Butterfly Nebula is one of those cosmic objects that demands our attention”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">To mark Gemini South's 25th anniversary, the NSF ran a First Light image contest among Chilean students; they chose the Butterfly Nebula (NGC 6302) and Gemini South (8.1 m) imaged it. The bipolar planetary nebula lay about 3,000 light‑years away in Scorpius and had formed when a massive progenitor shed its outer layers ~2,000 years earlier. Its exposed white dwarf, identified by Hubble in 2009, was extremely hot (about 250,000 °C), and later stellar winds tore through the lobes at &gt;3 million km/h.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““We’re teaching the robot to know its own limits when interacting with the environment while still achieving its goals.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers at CSAIL and LIDS developed a control framework that taught soft robots safe, contact-aware manipulation. They combined nonlinear control theory, physical modeling, and real-time optimization using high-order control barrier functions and high-order control Lyapunov functions to define safe force limits and guide task performance, enabling soft arms to embrace contact, avoid unsafe forces, and improve payload and precision despite complex dynamics.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““one day these same technologies could be assembling solar arrays, refueling satellites, or constructing lunar habitats,””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA and industry partners planned to fly and operate a commercial robotic arm in low Earth orbit on the Fly Foundational Robots (FFR) mission, which was set to launch in late 2027. FFR would test Motiv Space Systems’ dexterous, tool‑using, walking arm aboard an Astro Digital hosted flight through NASA’s Flight Opportunities program, with NASA as the inaugural guest operator. The demonstration aimed to advance ISAM capabilities—repair, refueling, assembly, habitat construction, and astronaut assistance—and was funded and managed by NASA’s ISAM portfolio and Goddard.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We have a much better appreciation for how those subtle structural changes can significantly increase the synthetic challenge.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT chemists synthesized verticillin A for the first time, a fungal compound isolated in 1970 that had shown anticancer potential but was hard to make because of its complex structure. They reported that the synthesis enabled creation of designed variants. A derivative showed promise against diffuse midline glioma in human cancer cells; authors said further testing was required. Mohammad Movassaghi and Jun Qi were the senior authors.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“All eight docking ports for spacecraft on the current configuration of the International Space Station (ISS) are fully occupied for the first time in the complex's history.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">All eight docking ports on the International Space Station were fully occupied for the first time, NASA said Dec. 1. Soyuz MS-28 docked at the Rassvet module on Nov. 28 carrying Chris Williams, Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev for an eight-month mission. Controllers had temporarily moved Cygnus-23 with Canadarm2 to clear the port; it was reinstalled at Unity's Earth-facing port. Other docked vehicles were Soyuz MS-27 (scheduled to depart Dec. 8), Progress-92 and -93, HTV-X1, CRS-33 Dragon and Crew-11 Dragon.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“A three-body problem is extremely complicated. Now we're dealing with four: the sun, Earth, the moon and Mars.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Time passed, on average, 477 microseconds per day faster on Mars than on Earth because of general relativity. NIST scientists Neil Ashby and Bijunath Patla calculated the discrepancy from Mars' weaker gravity, its orbital velocity and greater eccentricity, and gravitational influences of the sun, Earth and the moon. The difference varied by about 226 microseconds depending on Mars' orbital position and would affect future navigation and communications requiring synchronized clocks.</p>
