  <blockquote class="quote">“HydroGNSS, part of ESA's FutureEO programme, delivers observations on four hydrological parameters.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA's HydroGNSS was scheduled to launch on 20 November at 19:18 CET from Vandenberg on a SpaceX Falcon 9, with ESA Web TV live coverage from 19:01 CET. The Falcon 9 rideshare also carried Italy’s IRIDE and ICEYE satellites for Greece. HydroGNSS, part of the FutureEO programme, was designed to gather water-cycle data by GNSS reflectometry, delivering observations on four hydrological parameters and secondary products (ocean wind speed, sea-ice extent). It comprised two microsatellites in ~550 km orbits, 180° apart; times were subject to change.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““There’s an opportunity for AI to increase engineers’ productivity as well as make CAD more accessible to more people.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT engineers developed an AI model that used CAD software like a human, converting 2D sketches into 3D models by clicking buttons and menu options. They created VideoCAD, a dataset of more than 41,000 videos showing step-by-step CAD model construction, and trained the agent to perform those build sequences. The team framed the system as a potential &quot;CAD co-pilot&quot; to suggest or automate tedious steps and planned to present the work at NeurIPS in December.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“skills and lessons you learn as a student or a young employee can and will help you in your future work”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Brian Alpert had joined NASA’s Johnson Space Center after being inspired by a college talk and later became cross-program integration deputy for the Human Landing System. He coordinated with Orion and other Artemis programs on issue resolution, data exchanges, hardware integration and reviews, and co-led the Exploration Atmospheres Issue Resolution Team assessing vehicle atmosphere, spacesuit pressure and timelines. He drew on prior roles as a spacewalk instructor, flight controller and systems engineer, managed an Expedition 32 spacewalk failure response, valued teamwork, and enjoyed Johnson’s Chili Cookoff.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We were in the most intensive phase of the boxwork structures investigation — the drill campaign.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Nov. 7, 2025, the Curiosity team conducted a planned drill campaign in the boxwork unit, targeting paired bedrock sites in a hollow and an adjacent ridge. They had successfully drilled Valle de la Luna in the Monte Grande hollow and then moved about 10 meters to the ridge target Nevado Sajama. After a small positioning “bump,” engineers performed Drill Sol 1 coherency tests and APXS, ChemCam and MAHLI analyses following two years of campaign planning.</p>

  <p class="dek">Sentinel-6B launched Nov. 16 at 9:21 p.m. PST on a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Vandenberg Space Force Base and contacted a northern Canada ground station about 1 hour 30 minutes later; all systems were functioning normally. About the size of a pickup truck, the U.S.–European satellite continued decades of global sea-level measurements to improve hurricane and flood forecasts, protect coastal infrastructure and shipping, support astronaut reentry, and was to take over for Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich. The mission was a NASA, ESA, EUMETSAT, NOAA and EU Copernicus collaboration.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Euclid offered an unprecedented combination of sharpness and sky coverage.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">After one year of operations, ESA's Euclid mission had observed 1.2 million galaxies, which were cataloged in its first data release in March 2025. Launched in July 2023, Euclid was expected to study tens of millions by the end of its six-year primary mission. Researchers used the survey to probe galaxy morphology and coevolution with supermassive black holes, produced a 'galactic tuning fork' of evolution, and identified secondary nuclei indicating impending SMBH binaries and mergers. The release covered about 0.5% of the final dataset.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;greatest blunder.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article recounted how Einstein's 1917 application of general relativity predicted a dynamic universe, so he introduced the cosmological constant (Lambda) to achieve a static universe. Hubble later observed expansion, and Einstein called the constant his &quot;greatest blunder.&quot; In 1998, two teams measured cosmic acceleration rather than deceleration, reviving Lambda as dark energy. The discovery replaced the earlier Standard Model with LCDM cosmology, in which Lambda (dark energy) and cold dark matter described the universe's history.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the highlight of the week was the successful drilling of the 'Nevado Sajama' target.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">From a ridge-top perch, Curiosity team successfully drilled the Nevado Sajama target; APXS, ChemCam, and MAHLI data from the workspace and DRT-cleared targets showed chemistry consistent with other boxwork ridge targets. MAHLI imaged fine veins and confirmed the target's structural soundness after a drill-tip strength test. ChemCam analyzed veins on Arenas Blancas, Camarones, and Exaltación to probe penetrating fluids. DAN, REMS, RAD, Mastcam, and Navcam collected environmental and hydrogen/water data. Drilling finished on Sol 4718; samples were slated for CheMin analysis.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“To discover POP III stars, we really needed the sensitivity of JWST.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers reported that the James Webb Space Telescope may have found first-generation Population III stars in galaxy LAP1-B. Its light had traveled 13 billion years, showing LAP1-B as it was 800 million years after the Big Bang. Gravitational lensing by galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 magnified the galaxy about 100 times, enabling detection. POP III stars were thought to have formed ~200 million years after the Big Bang and had been elusive because they were very distant and faint.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Probably they were kissing.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Oxford investigated the evolutionary origins of kissing and argued Neanderthals likely kissed and may have kissed modern humans. Drawing on prior evidence of shared mouth microbes and Neanderthal DNA in non‑African humans, the team — led by Dr Matilda Brindle and publishing in Evolution and Human Behavior — developed a non‑human‑centric definition: friendly, directed mouth‑to‑mouth contact with some movement but no food transfer.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This data feeds into a flywheel of continuous improvement.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Waymo said it would launch in five new cities — Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando — and would accept rides there next year. No-passenger operations began in Miami and similar empty-vehicle runs in the other cities were planned over coming weeks to learn local quirks and update driving software. Waymo said this process required fewer changes per city, claimed its robotaxis had 11 times fewer serious-injury accidents than human drivers, listing existing services in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta and Austin.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“All motion was relative.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scott Lucchini and Jiwon Jesse Han used trajectories of hypervelocity stars found in Gaia DR3 to trace the Large Magellanic Cloud's recent path. They identified three candidate HVSs (HVS 3, HVS 7 and HVS 15) likely ejected from the LMC, ran Milky Way–LMC simulations including dynamical friction, and halved the LMC's possible corridor over millions of years. They did not resolve whether the LMC was on a first or second passage, but provided coordinates for a likely offset SMBH about 1.5° from the LMC’s visual center.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">HYPERSONIC EXPERIMENTS CONFIRM 60-YEAR TURBULENCE THEORY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The experimental data presented are supportive of Morkovin’s hypothesis.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported the first experimental measurements of wall‑normal turbulent fluctuations inside a hypersonic boundary layer, published in Nature Communications, and found results that supported Morkovin’s 1962 hypothesis. The hypothesis argued that, once density variations were accounted for, high‑Mach turbulence followed the incompressible pattern. Experiments at roughly Mach 6 (~4,600 mph) confirmed the theory and were said to affect modeling of heat loads and aerodynamic drag for future hypersonic vehicles.</p>

  <p class="dek">An image released July 23, 2025 showed nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1068. Its central black hole was twice as massive as the Milky Way’s, and NASA’s Chandra X-ray data indicated a million-mile-per-hour wind was being driven from the black hole and lighting the galaxy’s center in X-rays. The composite image combined Chandra X-rays (blue), NSF’s VLA radio data (pink), and Hubble and JWST optical/IR data (yellow, grey and gold).</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Comet 3I/ATLAS was only the third object ever identified as entering our solar system from elsewhere in the galaxy.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA hosted a live event at 3 p.m. EST on Nov. 19 at Goddard Space Flight Center to share imagery of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS taken by agency spacecraft and ground telescopes. Discovered by ATLAS on July 1, the comet was the third known interstellar object, posed no threat to Earth (closest approach ~170 million miles), and passed within 19 million miles of Mars in early October. Media registration was required.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“MIT has a long history of impactful collaborations with industry.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Sept. 15 MIT and GE Vernova launched the MIT‑GE Vernova Energy and Climate Alliance to advance research and education that accelerated the global energy transition. GE Vernova committed $50 million over five years for sponsored research, graduate fellowships, internships, experiential learning, and professional development. GE Vernova, spun off in April 2024 and based near MIT, was said to generate about 25% of the world’s electricity. Massachusetts officials attended and highlighted the $1 billion Mass Leads Act.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It tells stories of how past civilizations were able to refine raw materials from ore and then to metal.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers demonstrated that X-ray CT scanning noninvasively revealed fine internal structures in 5,000-year-old smelting slag from ancient Iran and complemented traditional cut-sample analyses. CT exposed pores and droplets of different materials, helping infer the materials and technological sophistication of Early Bronze Age metallurgy. They noted slag's chemical complexity — including arsenic prone to leaching — which complicated interpretation of the original metal-production processes.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Our oral health is connected to our general health.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers followed 65 patients at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS trust in London for two years after root canal treatment and found blood sugar levels fell significantly, suggesting removal of infection could help protect against type 2 diabetes. They also observed improved cholesterol and fatty acid profiles, reduced inflammation markers, and changes in more than half of analysed blood molecules, with short-term improvements in fat metabolism and longer-term reductions in blood glucose.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Humans, chimps, and bonobos all kiss,”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reconstructed the evolutionary origins of mouth-on-mouth kissing and concluded it had evolved more than 21 million years ago, likely present in the common ancestor of humans and other great apes. The study, published in Evolution and Human Behaviour, defined kissing as non-aggressive directed oral-oral contact with lip or mouthpart movement and no food transfer, and found matching behaviour in wolves, prairie dogs, polar bears, albatrosses; Neanderthals may have kissed too.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers led by Alex Merrow used Gaia proper motions, cosmological N-body simulations and published star-formation histories to predict orbits, infall times and pericentric passages for 39 M31 satellites. They found only the most massive satellites remained star-forming more than 3 billion years after pericentre, while lower-mass dwarfs (stellar mass &lt; 10^7.5 M⊙) were quenched long before encountering Andromeda, attributed to environmental processes.</p>

  <p class="dek">Lu Li and colleagues at the University of Michigan had reported in 2018 that the Kondo insulator ytterbium boride (YbB12) showed surface conduction yet surprising quantum oscillations consistent with bulk behavior. In a follow-up study published in Physical Review Letters, they used the National Magnetic Field Laboratory to obtain thermodynamic evidence that the oscillations were intrinsic to the bulk, appearing only above about 35 tesla. The team remained uncertain about practical applications.</p>

  <p class="dek">White dwarfs were the ultradense, dim cores left after sunlike stars died, supported by electron degeneracy pressure. They cooled from millions of kelvins and, after roughly 10 trillion years, became invisible black dwarfs; none existed in the present-day universe. The coldest known white dwarf was about 11 billion years old and ~3,000 K. Over extreme timescales (≈10^78 years) black dwarfs were predicted to evaporate via space-time curvature–induced pair production.</p>
