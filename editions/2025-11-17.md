  <blockquote class="quote">“Set to track sea levels across more than 90% of Earth’s ocean”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Sentinel‑6B, an ocean‑tracking satellite jointly developed by NASA and ESA, was packed into a Falcon 9 payload fairing for a targeted 12:21 a.m. EST Nov. 17 launch from Vandenberg. After a roughly 57‑minute launch sequence with stage separations, fairing jettison, and two second‑stage burns, the spacecraft separated, deployed solar panels minutes later, and made first contact about 35 minutes after separation. It was to orbit every 112 minutes and replace its twin to continue multidecade sea‑level measurements across over 90% of the oceans.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The geometry of a supernova explosion provides fundamental information on stellar evolution and the physical processes leading to these cosmic fireworks.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using VLT spectropolarimetry (FORS2), astronomers led by Yi Yang measured the early geometry of supernova SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621 (22 million light-years). Detected April 10 and observed April 11, the team inferred an initially olive-shaped blast that flattened while retaining a constant symmetry axis. The progenitor was a red supergiant about 500 solar radii and 12–15 solar masses. Published in Science Advances, the results suggested a large-scale axial symmetry in massive-star explosions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Skinsight”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers collaborated with South Korea's Amorepacific to develop a wearable &quot;electronic skin&quot; platform that debuted as Skinsight and was named a CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree. Skinsight was a Bluetooth-equipped sensor patch that stuck to the skin and paired with a mobile app to track skin tightness, UV exposure, temperature and moisture. The AI-powered app approximated how those factors contributed to skin aging and suggested products; the breathable, sweat-resistant patch's availability and cost were not yet announced.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">GROUNDWATER PUMPING TILTS EARTH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Earth’s rotational pole actually changes a lot.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Geophysical Research Letters study found that pumping about 2,150 gigatons of groundwater between 1993 and 2010 had tilted Earth’s rotational axis by roughly 31.5 inches, producing about 0.24 inches of sea-level rise. Researchers modeled polar drift and determined only scenarios including large groundwater redistribution matched observed motion; water extracted for irrigation and human use ultimately moved to the oceans. Midlatitude losses—particularly in western North America and northwestern India—drove much of the effect.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Sentinel-6B will ensure that we continue to collect the high-precision data needed to understand our changing climate.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Copernicus Sentinel-6B satellite was launched on 17 November at 06:21 CET aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Vandenberg and reached orbit under an hour; ESA received its signal at 07:54 CET via Inuvik. It carried radar altimetry to continue the sea-surface height record begun in the early 1990s and to extend the legacy of Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich. The mission, led by Copernicus and executed through international cooperation (European Commission, ESA, NASA, Eumetsat, NOAA, CNES), provided data for sea-level rise, wave height and wind speed.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;the younger the galaxy, the dimmer the supernova.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Part 4 described Nobel laureate Adam Reiss's critique of a paper claiming the Universe was decelerating. The paper had reported, from about 300 Type‑Ia supernovae, a correlation of peak brightness with host‑galaxy age and argued distances and ΛCDM were wrong. Reiss identified two flaws: modern catalogs adjusted for host‑galaxy mass (an age proxy) yet the authors used older data, and galaxy age did not reliably trace progenitor age, undermining their core assumption.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Sentinel-6B rising, extending nearly four decades of the precise sea-level record from space.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched the Sentinel-6B ocean-mapping satellite from Vandenberg Space Force Base on Nov. 17 at 12:21 a.m. EDT (0521 GMT), atop a Falcon 9 that marked the company’s 500th orbital mission using a flight‑proven booster. Sentinel‑6B, part of the EU Copernicus program, was to measure global sea-surface heights, continuing the record begun by its predecessor Sentinel‑6 Michael Frelich (launched Nov. 2020).</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“slim but significant evidence that dark energy might be getting weaker with time.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In March 2024 the DESI collaboration reported slim but significant evidence that dark energy might be weakening over time, after years of analysis. DESI was a roughly 4‑meter telescope on Kitt Peak using 5,000 robotic fiber‑optic cables, had cataloged over 13 million galaxies (aiming for 50 million), and relied on large‑scale features such as baryon acoustic oscillations—fossil sound‑wave shells from the early plasma—to probe cosmic expansion.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Once every 33 years, the shower puts on an amazing show.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Observers were advised to watch early Monday morning for the 2025 Leonid meteors and a possible second auroral storm. 2025 was an off year for the shower but featured a slim 6% waning crescent Moon rising two hours before sunrise, producing dark conditions, and lay within a decade of the 33-year peak that produced storms in 1999–2000. Active sunspot AR 4274 produced an X-class flare on Nov 14 and could have given a glancing blow to Earth on Nov 16/17, producing aurora.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It turned out that they’re almost as rational as we are.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Jan M. Engelmann at UC Berkeley tested whether chimpanzees could revise beliefs rationally. Using two- and three-container tasks with weak (crumbs or rattling) and strong (rattling, showing food through glass) evidence and varying evidence order, chimpanzees switched choices when weak evidence came first and later strong counterevidence, but stuck to choices when strong came first. In a three-container task they favored remaining weak evidence after the strong option was removed; a fourth experiment suggested mental representations.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;glowing central coma and lengthening smoke-like ion tail&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Virtual Telescope Project YouTube livestream on Nov. 16 (11:15 p.m. ET/0415 GMT Nov. 17) presented telescopic views of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it departed the solar system. Discovered July 1 and confirmed as the third interstellar visitor, the comet had passed perihelion on Oct. 30 and recently reemerged. Images on Nov. 11 showed a bright coma and an ion tail; at magnitude +10.9 it required a small telescope and rose in Virgo before dawn.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“For the first time, we uncovered an accurate image of what Edmontosaurus really looked like.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Edmontosaurus annectens, first found in 1908 by C.H. Sternberg and nicknamed the AMNH mummy, had scaly skin impressions. In a return expedition, Paul C. Sereno's team found two more mummies preserving fleshy external anatomy in sub-millimeter clay, yielding detailed scale and tail-spike anatomy and correcting century-old reconstructions by Knight and Horner. They located a fossil-rich &quot;mummy zone&quot; in an unusually thick part of the Lance Formation where frequent flooding produced clay-templating that preserved skin masks.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We nominally target a few hundred feet away from Jacklyn.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin's New Glenn launched for the second time on Nov. 13, successfully sending NASA's twin ESCAPADE Mars probes from Florida. Its two-stage rocket's 188-foot first stage returned and landed on the drone ship Jacklyn about 375 miles offshore. Founder Jeff Bezos posted landing videos on X and explained the booster had targeted a few hundred feet away from Jacklyn as a safety measure. Blue Origin named the stage &quot;Never Tell Me the Odds&quot; and used the motto &quot;Gradatim Ferociter.&quot;</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MOON TRAFFIC CRISIS LOOMS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“with only 50 satellites in lunar orbit, each of those satellites will need to maneuver four times a year”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Interest in the moon had risen, with 12 mission attempts in two years, many by private companies. Researchers noted that although cislunar space was about 2,000 times larger than Earth's orbital area, missions clustered in a few stable lunar orbits and tracking sensors were limited, increasing positional uncertainty. A March 2025 study in the Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets showed simulations that with 50 lunar satellites each would have to maneuver about four times per year; ISRO had maneuvered Chandrayaan-2 three times in four years.</p>
