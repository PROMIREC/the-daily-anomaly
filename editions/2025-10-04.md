  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;[It's] nothing more than an air-launched ballistic missile.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The U.S. continued to lag in the hypersonics race while China and Russia likely fielded multiple operational hypersonic weapons, some possibly nuclear-armed. The Air Force Research Laboratory unveiled Angry Tortoise, a lower-cost hypersonic missile slated for a December test at White Sands, which used Ursa Major’s Draper engine — a 4,000-pound-thrust, hydrogen peroxide–kerosene liquid engine with room-temperature storage, multi-restart capability and extensive 3D-printed parts.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BLUE ORIGIN AIMS TO LAND NEXT NEW GLENN BOOSTER, THEN</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We fully intend to recover the New Glenn first stage on this next launch.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin's second New Glenn launch was scheduled no earlier than November from Cape Canaveral and carried two NASA-funded satellites to study Mars' upper atmosphere, with stakes for a NASA mission and Space Force certification. The debut New Glenn reached orbit but its booster fell into the Atlantic after three engines failed to reignite; engineers identified seven fixes for propellant management and engine bleed control. Blue Origin said it intended to recover and reuse that booster on a January flight carrying the Blue Moon lander.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““Today’s yogurts are typically made with just two bacterial strains.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists investigated a Bulgarian tradition of adding live red wood ants to milk to kick-start yogurt fermentation. They recreated the method, analyzed microbial communities from live, frozen, and dried ants, and found live ants carried lactic and acetic acid bacteria and formic acid that acidified milk and, along with enzymes, helped coagulate it. Only live ants produced the desired microbial community. Chefs at Alchemist developed three recipes using strained ant yogurt.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a landmark moment in our work to protect Asian elephants”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported a breakthrough vaccine to prevent elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV), a leading cause of death in young Asian elephants. The vaccine, produced by an international team, was safe in adult Chester Zoo trials and activated antiviral immune responses. EEHV caused a haemorrhagic disease fatal within 24 hours and killed over 80% of juvenile cases; it affected zoos (seven calf deaths at Chester Zoo in a decade), sanctuaries and wild herds. Young calves were thought vulnerable during weaning as maternal antibodies declined.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">WHY DO AI DATA CENTERS USE SO MANY RESOURCES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“you can do that in parallel across the data set.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">With the AI boom, construction of new data centers had skyrocketed, and some communities had faced water shortages and strained power. Generative AI had shifted impacts toward more severe infrastructure burdens because AI used GPUs rather than CPUs. GPUs ran parallel workloads, consumed much more power, produced massive heat, and grew in size. A Lawrence Berkeley report showed electricity use rose from about 60 TWh (2014–16) to 176 TWh by 2023, and data center share rose from 1.9% to 4.4%.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a community united in its desire for a future flagship collider at CERN.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Physics Briefing Book for the 2026 European Strategy update was released on 2 October 2025 and synthesised community input to guide the European Strategy Group’s December recommendations. Compiled by the Physics Preparatory Group from 266 submissions and discussions at a Venice Open Symposium attended by over 600 physicists, the 12‑chapter book evaluated collider options, prioritised an electron–positron Higgs precision collider and a longer‑term energy‑frontier machine, and outlined technical, risk, timescale and cost considerations. Final national input was due 14 November.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;biological zero-day&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Microsoft-led team announced that it had discovered and possibly patched a “biological zero-day”: DNA-order screening systems could miss AI-designed protein toxins. The article explained that companies had long scanned DNA orders for sequences encoding known threats and updated algorithms for synonymous DNA, but AI protein design produced distantly related sequences that folded into toxic functions. The team tested AI-designed ricin variants and found some could evade existing screening, prompting the alarm.</p>

  <p class="dek">Nautilus executive editor Katherine Courage briefly described eight recent items she had enjoyed. She highlighted a Vox Unexplainable episode about missing Greenland ice-core sediments; Ologies episodes on tempestology and hurricane research flights; concern over U.S. funding cuts to FlyBase, the central Drosophila database; a 99% Invisible episode about library book weeding; and her appreciation for fact-checkers and a Merriam‑Webster dictionary she kept as a totem.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This makes it look to us as if the cube had been rotated.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Earlier this year, researchers at TU Wien and the University of Vienna recreated the Terrell–Penrose effect in an experiment published in Communications Physics. Led by Dominik Hornof and Peter Schattschneider, they combined pulsed lasers and high‑speed photography to 'slice' reflected light by optical path length and assemble composites, effectively slowing light to about 2 m/s. The images showed the predicted relativistic appearance: cubes appeared rotated while spheres remained spheres though poles shifted.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Limb darkening is where the edge of a star appears slightly dimmer than the center of a star.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article explained that exoplanet sizes from transits were limited by small transit depths and intrinsic stellar variability. It stated that limb darkening—edges of stars appearing dimmer than centers—altered transit statistics because planets first crossed dimmer limbs, increasing uncertainty. The authors reported that modeling and correcting for limb darkening using stellar spectra and main-sequence position could improve transit-depth accuracy by about fivefold, though limb darkening had been directly observed for only the Sun and a few stars.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I really like Enceladus because it has all the conditions that are at the same place at the time for life to evolve and to thrive”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists announced that Enceladus was spewing a wider array of carbon-based substances, which raised the assessed likelihood that the moon could be habitable. Experts said Enceladus combined complex organic molecules, a deep liquid ocean, suspected hydrothermal vents and suitable pH, salinity and temperature. They argued that searching locally was easier than detecting or corroborating biosignatures on exoplanets, which depended on planetary-scale atmospheric change and transits; Nathalie Cabrol concurred.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““Instead of the object, all you see is a diffuse fog.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists at Institut Langevin and TU Wien developed an acoustic technique that detected hidden objects by recording a “fingerprint matrix” of how target objects scattered sound, then matching it to backscattered waves measured after burying marble-sized metal spheres in glass-bead “sand.” Algorithms isolated the objects’ signatures despite multiple scattering and estimated positions accurately. The researchers suggested the approach could extend to other sensed properties and to medical imaging.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““Their claims are, a priori, very plausible, and the results are super interesting.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at Meta had developed V-JEPA (Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture), an AI that learned about the world from videos and displayed a notion of “surprise” when confronted with unphysical scenarios despite making no built-in physics assumptions. The article compared the model’s behavior to infant tests of object permanence, described limitations of pixel-space video models that treated every pixel equally, and noted JEPA, a still-image predecessor by Yann LeCun (2022), while citing experts who found the results plausible.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“In this image, you can clearly see the comet's greenish coma”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) was discovered Jan. 3 at Mt. Lemmon Observatory and, by late September, had brightened from magnitude +21.5 to about +7. It was expected to pass 55 million miles (89 million km) from Earth on Oct. 21 and reach perihelion on Nov. 8. Observers noted it was visible as a diffuse smudge in binoculars while astrophotographers captured long-exposure images of its green coma and ion tail; its brightening could be a transient outburst.</p>

  <p class="dek">Using JWST data, an international team led by Masafusa Onoue and Xuheng Ding examined two distant quasars (J2236+0032 and J1512+442) from about 12.9 billion years ago. NIRSpec observations showed their host galaxies had already grown to roughly 40–60 billion solar masses when the Universe was about 800 million years old, surprising researchers and informing theories about rapid early galaxy and massive black hole formation.</p>

Kimiya Yui said he took photos between workouts while passing over Honshu. Jonny Kim activated the SHRIMP humidity‑removal payload; Mike Fincke installed Heat Transfer Host 2 and configured the Fluid Science Laboratory with Kim; and Zena Cardman loaded sample cassettes for the ADvanced Space Experiment Processor‑4 to support pharmaceutical manufacturing in microgravity.</p>

  <p class="dek">World Space Week 2025 ran Oct. 4–10 with the theme &quot;Living in Space.&quot; Established in 1999 by the UN, WSW had become a global event across 90+ countries and marked Sputnik 1 (Oct. 4, 1957) and the Outer Space Treaty (Oct. 10, 1967). Organizers highlighted challenges of permanent off‑Earth habitation, noted growing orbital crew sizes, and said 2,617 events were registered — including Piccadilly's Space Artwork Mosaic, a NASA/Lockheed &quot;Living on the Moon&quot; forum and Crayola resources — aiming to inspire next-generation explorers.</p>

  <p class="dek">In February 2015 a photo of Cecilia Bleasdale's dress sparked a blue-and-black vs white-and-gold debate. Hyeyoung Shin, then a graduate student and later an assistant professor at Seoul National University, published a September Nature Neuroscience study showing primary visual cortex (V1) helped construct perception. In mice they used holographic lasers to stimulate a tiny V1 cluster, producing illusory shapes (Kanizsa triangle). They named those cells IC-encoder neurons and concluded perception filled gaps by inference shaped by experience and V1 circuitry.</p>

  <p class="dek">The article advised observing Jupiter and its Galilean moons in October, noting a season of rare double shadow transits produced by the 1-2-4 orbital resonance of Io, Europa and Ganymede. Callisto had resumed shadow transits that summer ahead of a mutual-transit/eclipse season the next year. It described Jupiter's quadrature on October 17, the 2026 opposition, historic observations by Rømer and Hooke, observing tips (100× magnification, Stellarium) and differing moon-shadow appearances.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“mushrooms evolved the ability to make the same psychoactive substance twice.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers led by Dirk Hoffmeister reported that unrelated mushrooms had independently evolved different enzymatic pathways to make the same psychoactive compound, psilocybin, marking a first-recorded case of convergent evolution within fungi. The study compared Inocybe corydalina (root-associated) and Psilocybe (saprotrophs), suggested psilocybin might deter predators such as insects, and noted implications for medical production because mushrooms grew slowly and current synthetic production produced hazardous waste and relied on small-scale steps.</p>
