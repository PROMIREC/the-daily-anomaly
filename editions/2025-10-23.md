  <blockquote class="quote">“reduced the risk of major adverse cardiac events by 20%”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The largest semaglutide trial, led by UCL and published in the Lancet, randomized 17,604 overweight or obese people aged 45+ across 41 countries to weekly semaglutide injections or placebo. Semaglutide had previously been shown to reduce major adverse cardiac events by 20%, and researchers found the cardiovascular benefit occurred regardless of kilograms lost, though reductions in waist circumference were linked to better heart outcomes, suggesting additional non-weight-loss mechanisms and broader potential use.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Sentinel-4 is the first European mission that will deliver hourly air-quality observations.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Sentinel-4 delivered first images showing nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone. Launched in July 2025 and hosted on the first Meteosat Third Generation Sounder in geostationary orbit, the ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared spectrometer was still undergoing commissioning when it provided preliminary hourly-view measurements over Europe and northern Africa (first acquired 8 October). It measured reflected solar light to resolve trace-gas spectral signatures and was to feed routine maps of pollutants into the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We are expecting to have no safety drivers in at least large parts of Austin by the end of this year.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Elon Musk predicted Tesla would remove human safety monitors from its robotaxis in parts of Austin by the end of the year and said Tesla planned robotaxi launches in 8-10 new markets before the end of 2025. He expected operations in 8-10 new states by year's end if regulators permitted. Tesla's Austin and San Francisco robotaxis had human monitors with kill switches, had logged over a quarter-million and over a million miles respectively, and the company planned to use monitors in new markets.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Phased array antennas are an evolutionary and much needed step towards more energy and space efficient in-flight connectivity solutions.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An ESA-supported experiment led Viasat to develop a dual-beam phased-array in-flight terminal, Viasat Amara, which could connect simultaneously to low-Earth-orbit satellites for low latency and geostationary satellites for high bandwidth. The ARTES-funded 2021 demonstration flight from Rotterdam to Payerne proved reliable streaming and video calls. The modular terminal was to be commercialised starting in 2028 and was designed for easy retrofit into existing passenger aircraft.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“A Red Supergiant with Carbon-rich Circumstellar Dust”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers used JWST and archival Hubble images to identify the progenitor of Type II SN 2025pht in spiral galaxy NGC 1637 about 32 million light years away. New ApJ Letters research led by Charles Kilpatrick presented pre-explosion imaging, follow-up imaging and spectroscopy from 31 to 0.7 years before discovery, revealing a red supergiant embedded in thick, carbon-rich circumstellar dust. The finding addressed the 'red supergiant problem' of lower-than-predicted observed luminosities.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“But it can quietly corrode reasoning, ethics, and long-context attention.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&amp;M, and Purdue fed popular, low-quality social media text to open-source Llama and Qwen during pretraining and found a “brain rot” effect: reduced reasoning, degraded memory, decreased ethical alignment and increased psychopathy on measures, mirroring human findings. Models trained on sensational, viral posts were not easily recovered by retraining, raising concerns about using social-media-generated data for model training.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“You evolve the system forward in time, then you apply a small butterfly perturbation, and then you evolve the system backward in time.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google and academic collaborators published a paper describing &quot;quantum echoes,&quot; a method that reportedly demonstrated a quantum advantage over current classical algorithms and could be practically useful. The approach applied a sequence of two-qubit gates (forward evolution), a randomized single-qubit perturbation, then the reverse two-qubit gates; interference among alternative quantum paths (out-of-time-order correlations, OTOCs) determined final outcomes. The work followed Google's earlier contested quantum supremacy claim and the field had shifted toward quantum utility and advantage.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“played vital and diverse roles in shaping ecosystems across the Americas”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reconstructed diets of two giant ground sloth species from the La Brea Tar Pits—Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotheriops shastensis) and Harlan’s ground sloth (Paramylodon harlani)—that lived side by side in what was now Southern California. They reported these Pleistocene giants, which dated back as far as 35 million years and reached enormous sizes, had played vital, diverse ecosystem roles that disappeared when they went extinct in Southern California about 13,700 years ago. The study was published in Biology Letters.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“mRNA can train immune systems to kill tumors”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Authors reported in Nature that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, which had saved about 2.5 million lives during the pandemic, could also spark the immune system to fight cancer. Their conclusion was based on a 2016 finding from Elias Sayour’s team that mRNA could train immune systems to kill tumors even when the mRNA was not cancer‑related, leading them to hypothesize that SARS‑CoV‑2–targeted mRNA vaccines might have antitumor effects.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The real headline wasn't about robots.. It's about people—and the future of work we’re building together.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Amazon issued a PR response after a New York Times report about automation, showcasing 10 robots and highlighting Blue Jay and Project Eluna. Blue Jay was described as “an extra set of hands,” could move 75% of stored item types, and had been developed in just over a year using AI, digital twins, and existing robot data to coordinate multiple arms and collapse three stations into one for Same-Day sites. Amazon reiterated job-creation claims and Jassy had said AI would reduce some roles.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This virus has a severe effect on animal welfare and productivity.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists at the Roslin Institute created pigs gene-edited to resist classical swine fever (CSF) by altering the DNAJC14 gene, which was required for pestivirus replication. In a biosecure trial at APHA, four edited pigs and four controls were exposed: controls developed symptoms and high viral loads within a week, while edited pigs remained healthy and showed no infection. Several edited generations showed no adverse health or fertility effects.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Open-weight models are crucial for advancing embodied AI.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">European researchers at INSAIT in Bulgaria released SPEAR-1, an open-source robotic foundation model trained with 3D data to improve physical-world understanding and manipulation. Martin Vechev said open-weight models should accelerate embodied AI experimentation. SPEAR-1 performed roughly on par with commercial robot models on the RoboArena benchmark and approached Pi-0.5 from Physical Intelligence. The article noted that robot models still often required retraining for different arms or environments, and researchers hoped more data and compute would yield more general robot intelligence.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The space environment health index is an elegant approach”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA introduced a Space Environment Health Index in its yearly Space Environment Report to summarise the orbital environment with a single score reflecting health or stress and projected consequences over a 200-year period. It was intended to quantify how missions and objects affected orbital sustainability, enable high-level assessment and evaluate individual missions. The metric drew on nearly ten years of ESA and European academic work, supported ESA’s Zero Debris aim to eliminate debris generation by 2030, and was endorsed by Stijn Lemmens.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SECOND FIREBALLS BUSTED AS REFLECTIONS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;probably the cause of these double events.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Oct. 16 (and again Oct. 17), observers across parts of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, including North Branford, Connecticut, reported a bright green fireball; videos appeared to show a second meteor moving in perfect formation and disappearing simultaneously. American Meteor Society expert Robert Lunsford said the apparent doubles were probably optical illusions caused by clear acrylic domes/anti-fogging measures on the camera housings, noting the secondary images held fixed positions relative to the main events. The article linked astrophotography guides and invited reader submissions.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SUN DIMMING THREATENS GLOBAL WEATHER</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It isn't just a matter of getting five teragrams of sulfur into the atmosphere. It matters where and when you do it.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article reported that stratospheric sulfur injection (SAI) could temporarily cool Earth by scattering sunlight, as seen after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption which lowered global mean temperature ~0.5°C, but researchers found it had unwanted side effects. Models had uncertainties; SAI risked disrupting monsoons (causing South Asian drought when particles accumulated), altering global circulation depending on injection location, warming the stratosphere and accelerating ozone loss, and producing acid rain that harmed soils. Scientists warned outcomes were broader and less predictable than idealized simulations suggested.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“either model fit within the uncertainties”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Dark matter was described as massive yet nonluminous; neutrinos met those criteria but were too fast and too few, leaving dark matter's composition unknown. The article summarized a study that modeled WIMP decay effects on background light, calculating scattering cross-sections for two cases: purely gravitational interactions (low-energy photons forward-scattered, producing tiny blueshifts) and weakly interacting decays (photons backscattered, producing tiny redshifts). The effects were very small but both models matched Fermi‑LAT galactic‑center data within uncertainties; better gamma observations could discriminate.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“these drugs are not identical – some can lead to meaningful changes in weight, heart rate and blood pressure in a relatively short period.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A major review led by King’s College London and the University of Oxford analysed 151 clinical trials of 30 antidepressants in more than 58,000 people and found notable variation in physical side-effects. Most studies lasted about eight weeks, yet some drugs were linked to up to 2kg weight gain within two months while others produced weight loss; average differences reached about 4kg (2.5kg loss with agomelatine vs 2kg gain with maprotiline). Heart-rate differences reached 21 bpm and blood-pressure 11 mmHg. Researchers urged guideline updates.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Quanta piece described how, unlike illegal human collusion, learning pricing algorithms repeatedly adjusted prices and could tacitly collude. A 2019 study had shown simple algorithms learned retaliatory strategies that sustained high prices. A recent paper by Aaron Roth and colleagues proved that even algorithms unable to express threats could still produce high prices while optimizing profits, complicating regulation because harmful outcomes could appear superficially reasonable.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““It’s like you know there’s a seating chart.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT scientists published an open‑access Nature Communications paper describing DIGIT, a computational imaging method that used a material’s known atomic configuration as a prior to infer individual atom positions from optical microscope data. DIGIT enabled localization to 0.178 angstroms, overcoming limits that had kept atoms beyond optical and super‑resolution microscopy. The technique was applied to crystalline materials and some repeating proteins and was expected to aid quantum‑device design and the study of defects and impurities in advanced materials.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“All three worlds will lie within 10 degrees of each other”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Skywatchers were told to look southwest at sunset on Oct. 23 to see a 6%-lit waxing crescent moon about 5° above the horizon near Mercury (upper right) and Mars, which all lay within roughly 10° of each other. Mercury and Mars fit in the field of view of 10x50 binoculars. The trio set less than an hour after the sun, making the thin crescent hard to spot against twilight; viewers were cautioned not to point optics at the sun and to confirm local sunset times.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Materials that go into making planets are formed inside of stars that have different lifetimes,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article explained that the Big Bang produced hydrogen and little helium, and that stars forged heavier elements (astronomical 'metals') which over generations increased galactic metallicity. New research (‘Effect of Galactic Chemical Evolution on Exoplanet Properties’, ApJ Letters) by Jason Steffen modeled how element-production timing affected planet formation: early death of massive stars enriched environments with oxygen, silicon and magnesium, producing larger mantles and smaller cores, while later iron/nickel from low-mass stars enlarged cores, yielding older rocky planets that were less dense and matched observations.</p>

  <p class="dek">Astronomers imaged a faint companion to red supergiant Betelgeuse — nicknamed Betelbuddy — after Gemini North spotted it and Carnegie Mellon researchers followed up with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble when the companion was at maximum separation. The observations were the deepest X-ray data of Betelgeuse to date. No accretion signatures of a white dwarf or neutron star were seen; researchers instead suspected a young, Sun-mass stellar object, creating an extreme mass-ratio binary.</p>
