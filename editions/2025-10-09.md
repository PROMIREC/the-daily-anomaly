  <blockquote class="quote">“Our spacecraft appears happy and healthy.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA reinstated funding for the OSIRIS-APEX mission, reversing a Trump administration plan to cancel it. OSIRIS-APEX repurposed the healthy OSIRIS-REx spacecraft to visit asteroid Apophis during its close Earth flyby in April 2029. The White House had proposed canceling 19 missions amid a nearly 50% cut to NASA science, but House and Senate bills preserved much funding. Agency officials temporarily planned for cuts; many other missions remained vulnerable during a partial government shutdown.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“immunology-informed therapies to slow or prevent neurodegeneration and age-related cognitive decline”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">At MIT’s Sept. 18 symposium “The Neuro-Immune Axis and the Aging Brain,” speakers presented research showing interactions between the central nervous and immune systems shaped aging and neurodegenerative disease. Michal Schwartz described immunotherapies that rejuvenated microglia and recruited macrophages to improve Alzheimer’s outcomes; Li‑Huei Tsai reported microglial gene expression patterns, microglial exhaustion, and possible T‑cell involvement in Alzheimer’s. Other presenters linked vagus‑nerve brain–body immune signaling to declining airway defenses with age.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“SDSS J0715-7334 is the closest thing we've found to a pristine, metal-free star.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article stated that the Big Bang produced mainly hydrogen and helium, so later-formed heavier elements ('metals') traced stellar generations. Astronomers found SDSS J0715-7334, a red giant in the Large Magellanic Cloud halo with metallicity ten times lower than the most primordial galaxies observed, making it the closest to pristine. Its elemental pattern indicated formation in the supernova remnant of a ~30-solar-mass progenitor; its very low carbon implied dust-assisted formation of a small early star, and its motion showed it formed in the LMC halo.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ICE GIANTS' TITLE UNDER FIRE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the interiors of Uranus and Neptune remain enigmatic”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Zurich used computer models and new algorithms, constrained by planetary data (mass, equatorial and reference radii, pressure, rotation period, gravitational moments), to simulate Uranus and Neptune interiors. They found both planets' interiors were dominated by rock and water, with Uranus's rock-to-water ratio about ten times Neptune's, prompting a suggestion to reclassify them from “ice giants” to “rock giants.” They concluded that current data remained insufficient and advocated multiple models and future missions; Voyager 2 was the only visitor.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Ammonia has the most carbon dioxide emissions of any kind of chemical,&quot; says Green.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Ammonia was one of the most widely produced chemicals, mainly as fertilizer, and its production accounted for up to 20% of greenhouse gases from the chemical industry. MIT researchers combined two production methods to minimize waste and, with simple upgrades, could reduce emissions by as much as 63% versus the leading low‑emissions approach, according to a paper in Energy &amp; Fuels. The article recounted Haber‑Bosch origins and compared blue (CCS) and green (electrolysis) ammonia, costs, and rising demand.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We are the first to apply MCTS to scene generation by framing the scene generation task as a sequential decision-making process.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at MIT CSAIL and the Toyota Research Institute developed a “steerable scene generation” method to create realistic 3D environments for robot training. Trained on over 44 million 3D rooms, their system steered a diffusion model and used Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to sequentially in-paint and refine scenes, enforcing physical realism (avoiding clipping). MCTS produced denser, more complex scenes (e.g., up to 34 items versus an average of 17) and could diversify scenarios via reinforcement learning.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Dust devils make the normally invisible wind visible.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers tracked 1,039 Martian dust devils in two decades of ESA Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter images and measured speeds up to 98 mph (158 kph), exceeding prior rover measurements and climate models. Published Oct. 8 in Science Advances, the team used AI to detect frame-to-frame color-channel offsets in the orbiters' cameras to calculate each whirlwind's speed and direction, enabling wind mapping and aiding mission planning for dust impacts on rovers and landings.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">NOBEL PRIZE SHOCK: CIRCUITS GO QUANTUM</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“quantum effects persist even in large electrical circuits”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to three scientists whose 1984–85 experiments showed that even large superconducting electrical circuits (made from niobium and lead and cooled near absolute zero) behaved quantum mechanically. John Martinis, Michel Devoret and John Clarke demonstrated that voltages and currents were governed by quantum mechanics, that the circuit had quantized energy levels and could occupy superpositions, enabling development of practical quantum technologies. The author Eli Levenson-Falk disclosed no conflicts.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;New Glenn stands about 320 feet tall (98 meters) when fully stacked.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin rolled a New Glenn first stage out to a Cape Canaveral launch pad on Oct. 8 to prepare for an upcoming liftoff, expected late October or November, that would send NASA's twin ESCAPADE probes to Mars. New Glenn was about 320 feet tall when stacked and used a reusable first stage. Its debut in January reached orbit but failed a sea landing. The ESCAPADE orbiters, named Blue and Gold and built by Rocket Lab, had arrived in Florida on Sept. 22.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Open and Shared Sustainable Mega-Constellation (OSSMC)”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at China's National University of Defense Technology argued that the planned proliferation of megaconstellations risked LEO overcrowding and Kessler Syndrome, with filings showing over 1 million satellites planned and estimates of a 175,000 safe-capacity at 50 km spacing. They proposed an Open and Shared Sustainable Mega-Constellation (OSSMC) with modular, cloud-like satellites using a Sensors+Network+AI (SNAI) and Cloud-Pool-Terminal paradigm. Simulations reduced collision metrics by double digits, cut costs 19.15%, and improved positional accuracy (GDOP) 51.07%, while lowering required satellites below 50,000.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““These objects are the first building blocks we can observe from those systems.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">3I/Atlas, detected in July, was the third interstellar comet observed after 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019). Interstellar comets were made of star‑system leftovers and formed comae and two tails when heated. 3I/Atlas was predicted to pass closer to the Sun and thus produce more gas and dust for study; early size estimates ranged 440 m–5.6 km. Hubble showed an anti‑tail; VLT spectra indicated a high nickel‑to‑iron ratio and unusual polarisation.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“team diversity in personality traits may contribute to greater resilience under extended isolation and operational load.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the Stevens Institute of Technology used agent-based modeling to simulate a 500-day Mars mission and tested how mixtures of five major personality traits across roles affected stress, health and teamwork. Published Oct. 8 in PLOS One, the study by Iser Pena and Hao Chen found that crews with broader personality diversity—especially mixes of highly conscientious and low-neurotic individuals—maintained better cooperation, lower stress and greater resilience, and argued that psychological diversity should inform astronaut selection and training.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“it'll just see that positive charge and kind of want to move toward it, but it can't get to it”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at EeroQ described a qubit system that trapped lone electrons on liquid helium. They explained that an electron was bound to its image charge at the helium surface, and that liquid helium at up to 4 K provided vacuum conditions and flowed through silicon-chip channels as a superfluid. A tungsten filament loaded electrons into a storage basin; superconducting electrodes created adjustable traps. By lowering trap walls they drained electrons to zero/one/two states, detected those via resonator frequency shifts, and held a single electron indefinitely.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“paved the way for the next generation of quantum technology”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">This year’s Nobel prizes in chemistry, physics and physiology or medicine celebrated work that paved the way for next-generation quantum technology, created porous materials likened to Hermione Granger’s handbag, and discovered a previously hidden internal 'army' that helped keep the immune system in check. Madeleine Finlay spoke with Guardian science editor Ian Sample and correspondents Nicola Davis and Hannah Devlin.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“SpIRIT is a complex satellite designed and built in Australia.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Australia's SpIRIT nanosatellite snapped its first space 'selfie' after launching in December 2023 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 and completing commissioning. The University of Melbourne‑led mission tested its winged thermal management, thermal radiator, deployable camera arm, electric propulsion thruster, transceivers and solar panels. SpIRIT — the first Australian Space Agency‑funded space telescope to carry an Italian Space Agency HERMES X‑ray detector — logged over 600 days and 9,000 orbits, detected the Crab gamma pulsar, and moved to detecting gamma‑ray bursts as an early warning system.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I don’t think it’s particularly strong at all.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A paper published in October 2024 in Acta Paediatrica by Timothy Bayne and Joel Frohlich proposed using four adult markers—default mode network, attentional blink, multisensory integration (McGurk effect), and the local–global P300 response—as evidence of core consciousness if found in infants or fetuses. Researchers had found rudimentary DMN in newborns, long attentional blinks by five months, McGurk-like effects by four–five months, and P300-like responses in newborns and fetuses from 35 weeks. Bayne cautioned the evidence was suggestive and infant conscious states likely differed from adults'.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“At the origin of animals, there wasn’t so much gene innovation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that the rise of complex animals such as cnidarians and ctenophores, which emerged about 740–520 million years ago, did not depend on novel genes but on new patterns of gene regulation. A Nature study led by Arnau Sebé-Pedrós argued that chromatin looping—bringing distant chromosome regions into contact—enabled modular temporal and spatial gene expression, enabling multicellular complexity.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“One gram of a MOF has so many pores that it can expose as much internal surface area as a soccer field.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded on Oct. 8, 2025 to Richard Robson, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi for developing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). A Rice University MOF scientist described MOFs as tunable crystalline scaffolds of metal nodes and organic linkers that formed highly ordered, extremely porous frameworks. One gram could expose internal surface area comparable to a soccer field. Their nanoscale pores allowed MOFs to trap, separate, transform or transport gases, ions and other molecules; the prize felt historic and personal to researchers.</p>

Their independently begun work in the 1970s–1980s was cited for capturing carbon dioxide and PFAS. They shared 11 million Swedish kronor; Kitagawa was at Kyoto University, Robson at the University of Melbourne and Yaghi at the University of California. Robson used wooden-ball models in demonstrations.</p>
