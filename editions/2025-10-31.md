  <h3 class="hed">NANOTYRANNUS GENUS FINALLY CONFIRMED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““This fossil doesn’t just settle the debate. It flips decades of T. rex research on its head.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Nature paper settled a four‑decade debate by concluding Nanotyrannus was a valid genus with two species. Researchers analyzed the well‑preserved “dueling dinosaurs” specimen and re‑examined other fossils (including “Jane”), using growth‑ring analysis, spinal fusions, developmental anatomy and CT scans. The dueling dinosaurs individual was nearly mature (~20 years) and differed from T. rex by larger forelimbs, a possible vestigial third finger, fewer tail vertebrae, more teeth and distinct skull nerve patterns. Jane was named N. lethaeus; the other was N. lancensis.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">NEW RADIO COLOUR REVEALS MILKY WAY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““This low-frequency image allows us to unveil large astrophysical structures in our Galaxy that are difficult to image at higher frequencies.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Australian researchers ran an 18-month GLEAM‑X radio survey and used 40,000 supercomputer hours to produce a radio‑colour image of the Milky Way. They mapped low-frequency bands to RGB; the image succeeded the 2019 GLEAM image, focused on the Galaxy, and had twice the resolution, twice the sky coverage and ten times the sensitivity. The PASA paper led by Silvia Mantovanini said the image revealed large-scale structures, helped distinguish supernova remnants (large red circles) from stellar nurseries (small blue), and would aid follow-up studies.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SUPERNOVA DEFIES INTERACTION EXPECTATIONS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We applied a non-traditional and unprejudiced perspective.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers studied SN 2024bch, a Type II supernova about 65 million light-years away first observed in February 2024, for 140 days with ground telescopes and the Swift spacecraft. Although narrow emission lines appeared in its spectra—typically taken as evidence of violent ejecta–circumstellar medium interaction—the team found no such interaction. They attributed the lines and energy to Bowen fluorescence (UV-excited helium transferring energy to oxygen and nitrogen), prompting reconsideration of Type II models and implications for neutrino and multimessenger astronomy.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Callisto, Themis and Skyhopper are different demonstration programs contributing to the development of a European reusable launch vehicle.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Europe's ArianeGroup flew a series of demonstrators (Callisto, Themis and Skyhopper) to develop sovereign reusable launch capabilities, powered by the Prometheus methane–liquid oxygen engine. Early testing occurred in France and campaigns ran from Esrange Spaceport in Kiruna, where the 30 m Themis T1H was moved and fitted with landing legs ahead of low-altitude vertical landing tests. Under the SALTO/Horizon Europe programme, a full-stage recovery demonstration was planned for 2027–2028, with potential operational capability in the early 2030s.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">NASA'S QUIET SUPERSONIC JET SOARS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The X-59 performed exactly as planned.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Nearly a decade after NASA partnered with Lockheed Martin, the X-59 Quiet SuperSonic Technology aircraft completed its first California flight, from Plant 42 in Palmdale to NASA's Armstrong center in Edwards. NASA and Lockheed planned further tests to measure the jet's sound signature and run community acceptance testing. The X-59 was designed to fly supersonic with reduced booms through a top-mounted engine and pointed nose, and the program aimed to inform new acceptable noise thresholds after the U.S. supersonic flight ban was lifted.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we’ve learned what dark matter isn’t.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described the CRESST experiment beneath Italy's Gran Sasso ('great rock'), which used a millikelvin-cooled calcium tungstate (Scheelite) crystal to detect dark matter via vibrations that would disturb its superconducting state. CRESST operated for years without confirmed detections but constrained dark matter properties, ruling out ranges of mass and interaction strength. The piece explained experiments had excluded neutrinos, outlined the theory/experiment roles, and noted candidate masses spanned ~10^-21 to 10^24–10^30 eV.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Quenching, a powerful heat transfer mechanism, is remarkably effective at transporting heat away.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Marco Graffiedi was a fifth‑year doctoral student at MIT’s Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering who researched quenching to improve cooling for future spaceships and nuclear plants. He grew up in Italy, built a passive hydraulic system at 14, attended the International Physics Olympiad, and did physics experiments in high school. He earned degrees in mechanical engineering from Università di Pisa and Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna, researched concentrated solar power, completed a fracture‑mechanics thesis with GE Oil and Gas, and interned at Fermilab.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Starship provided unmatched capability to explore the moon”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX held the contract to land NASA astronauts on Artemis 3 (expected 2028). NASA reopened the landing contract to competition, citing Starship delays; Starship had flown 11 uncrewed tests but had not reached orbit or demonstrated in-space propellant transfer. Elon Musk criticized NASA. SpaceX posted a &quot;To the Moon and Beyond&quot; update, said it was developing core and Artemis-lander paths in parallel, reported 49 completed milestones under its fixed-price lander contract, and planned an orbital upper-stage flight and in-space refueling test in 2026.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We must ensure safety in Earth orbit to have a future in space.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA’s Space Safety Programme was dedicated to detecting, predicting and mitigating space hazards — natural (asteroids, solar storms) and human-made (space debris) — and was building a fleet of missions and projects to secure a sustainable future in space. Ahead of the 2025 Ministerial Conference it proposed activities to ensure independent continuous access to critical data and satellite services for Europe. Planned efforts included the Vigil space-weather mission, asteroid-defence work and missions like Hera and Ramses, and orbital cleanup to prevent new debris.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We've created a laser drill that enables deep, narrow and energy-efficient access to ice without increasing instrument mass&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the Institute of Aerospace Engineering at Technische Universität Dresden developed a laser-based ice drill that vaporized ice (sublimation) to bore deep, narrow channels while keeping instruments at the surface. The concept used about 150 watts and a projected mass of about 4 kg independent of depth, produced narrow boreholes for upward gas and dust sampling, and claimed faster, lower-mass access than mechanical drills or melting probes; added analyzers would raise mass and power needs.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a long, narrow stellar stream extending Northward from the MW-like galaxy M61”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Vera Rubin Observatory saw first light in June 2025 with Virgo First Look images that revealed a previously unseen 163,000-light-year stellar stream emanating northward from spiral galaxy Messier 61 (NGC 4303). A research letter led by Aaron Romanowsky (to appear in RNAAS) reported the stream as a tidal remnant of a disrupted dwarf or cluster; its progenitor (infall halo ~8×10^10 M⊙) could have triggered M61's bar, starburst, and AGN. The stream ended in a complex 9×4 kpc plume.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We have a lot of things we still need to understand.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A study published in Nature Aging suggested drugs targeting the circadian protein REV-ERBα could slow Alzheimer’s. In mice, deleting REV-ERBα (globally or in astrocytes) raised NAD+ levels and protected against tau. A related Nature Neuroscience paper found amyloid disrupted daily gene rhythms, causing sporadic gene firing, impaired microglial clearance and new inflammatory rhythms that could worsen decline. Researchers said manipulating the internal clock might offer therapeutic potential but required more research.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“difficult to understand”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A group of at least 15 fertility patients, including people with cancer and fertility problems, sued to stop frozen embryos being destroyed after clinics failed to renew storage consents because of administrative errors. Errors followed law changes in 2020 and 2022 extending storage periods with 10-year consent renewals; clinics missed contacts, held wrong dates, or continued to accept payments. Applicants said they had been left 'in limbo' for nearly a year.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">TARDIGRADE PROTEIN PROMISES RADIATION SHIELD</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“damage suppressor (Dsup) protected DNA.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A protein from tardigrades inspired potential cancer and cardiovascular therapies. Tardigrades survived boiling, freezing, crushing pressure and outer space, and tolerated radiation up to 2,000 times human cells. In 2016 researchers found a unique gene encoding a tardigrade-only protein; when introduced into human cells it increased radiation resistance. Named damage suppressor (Dsup), it protected DNA. Researchers, including the author, investigated Dsup’s mechanism to inform therapies, but proposed models had varied experimental support and no consensus emerged.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“as a reference design for the Android XR ecosystem.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Magic Leap revealed an Android XR smart‑glasses prototype and expanded its partnership with Google, saying the device was built &quot;as a reference design for the Android XR ecosystem.&quot; The glasses ran Google’s Android XR OS, combined Magic Leap’s waveguides and optics with Google’s Raxium microLED light engine, and resembled modern thick‑framed smart glasses with a left‑side camera. The company, majority‑owned by Saudi PIF after a &gt;$1B investment, had shifted from weak consumer sales to enterprise (Magic Leap 2) and licensing.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ROCKET METALS THREATEN OZONE LAYER</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“space waste”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A paper by Leonard Schulz et al. reported burning satellites and rocket debris were injecting transition metals into the stratosphere. Total mass from launches remained smaller than meteors, but metal content was proportionally larger, and anthropogenic sources became the leading contributor for more elements (18 in 2015, 24 in 2024; possibly 30). Metals like copper and titanium more than doubled injections over past decade from mega-constellations. The paper warned of three risks: catalytic ozone loss, cloud‑seeding changes and radiative effects, and noted uncertainty about impacts.</p>
