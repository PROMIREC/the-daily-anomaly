  <blockquote class="quote">“first crewed mission to the moon since 1972”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA said Artemis 2 could launch as early as February, with flight opportunity on February 6, and began final preparations. It planned to roll the SLS and Orion four miles to Pad 39B in a 12‑hour move and targeted rollout January 17 or later depending on weather and technical needs. It scheduled a late‑January wet dress rehearsal to load cryogenic propellants and run a countdown. The 10‑day, four‑astronaut mission tested Orion life‑support, orbited Earth twice, then went 4,700 miles beyond the moon’s far side.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““we’re a long way away from understanding the brain like we understand the heart.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">At CES, companies showcased consumer EEG devices that monitored brain electrical activity and grouped signals into gamma, beta, alpha, theta and delta waves. Experts said EEGs offered real-time monitoring and diagnostic potential but cautioned that neuroscience lagged behind cardiology. Consumer products ranged from the sleep-focused Zeo to Muse meditation headbands and Neurable’s MW75S and HyperX gaming headsets, which claimed to train calm focus and improve reaction time; the author described a Neurable demo using Aimlabs and a focus-training dots exercise.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Ocean heat content is in many ways the most reliable thermostat of the planet.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers compiled annual ocean-heat measurements and reported that 2025 set a record—the eighth consecutive year of rising ocean heat—when the oceans absorbed an additional 23 zettajoules, up from 16 zettajoules in 2024. A team of more than 50 scientists wrote that oceans absorbed over 90% of excess atmospheric heat, that much energy moved into deeper layers, and that 2025 had slightly lower sea-surface temperatures amid a weak La Niña.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;math IS the universe, it IS matter.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article was Part 3 of a series on the mathematical universe hypothesis and described Roger Penrose’s Triangle of Reality (math, matter, mind). It explained Tegmark’s claim that math constituted the universe and minds, so conscious beings were mathematical structures. Using the Mandelbrot fractal and the bird (external) versus frog (internal) perspectives, it argued that free will, time, and space were illusory and compared existence to software in a video‑game analogy.</p>

  <p class="dek">An Indian PSLV return-to-flight mission apparently failed after liftoff Jan. 11 (Jan. 12 IST), carrying the EOS-N1 (Anvesha) military hyperspectral Earth-observation satellite and 15 other payloads. ISRO reported increased vehicle roll disturbance near the end of the third-stage burn and a resulting flight-path deviation; data were being analyzed. It was the PSLV's first launch since a May 2025 third-stage anomaly, and would have been the fourth failure in 64 flights.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“removed two of its historic test stands.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, removed two historic test stands—the Propulsion and Structural Test Facility and the Dynamic Test Facility—by carefully coordinated implosions on Jan. 10, 2026. The demolitions were part of a broader Marshall project begun in spring 2022 to clear inactive structures and create a dynamic, interconnected campus; crews had begun demolition at the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator in December 2025.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ASTRONAUT AILMENT FORCES EARLY SPLASHDOWN</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“absolutely stable”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA decided to end Crew-11’s mission about a month early because of a medical concern affecting one astronaut. It was the agency’s first mission cut short for medical reasons; NASA did not identify the crewmember or the condition. It targeted a return no earlier than January 14, with an approximate California splashdown Jan. 15 if plans held. An ISS spacewalk had been postponed; NASA said the affected astronaut was “absolutely stable” and onboard medical gear couldn’t yield a full diagnosis.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we’ve had a serious enough medical emergency in space to bring a crew home early.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Jan. 8, 2026, NASA announced it would return SpaceX Crew-11 early after a crew member required full medical services; the unidentified member was reported stable. Crew-11—Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Kimiya Yui and Oleg Platonov—was scheduled to splash down in the Pacific off California on Jan. 15 at about 3:40 a.m. EST. NASA coordinated with SpaceX and partners on Crew-12 options, provided change-of-command and coverage timelines, and reported favorable splashdown weather.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““Transcranial focused ultrasound will let you stimulate different parts of the brain in healthy subjects, in ways you just couldn’t before.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers described transcranial focused ultrasound as an emerging, noninvasive tool that reached deeper brain structures with higher spatial resolution than magnetic or electrical stimulation by transmitting acoustic waves through the skull to focus on millimeter-scale targets. Two MIT researchers planned experiments and co-authored a &quot;roadmap&quot; paper in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews that proposed using the method to causally probe neural substrates of conscious perception and study sensations, pain, vision, and complex thought.</p>

  <p class="dek">Space Forge produced the first in-orbit plasma aboard its ForgeStar-1 satellite, demonstrating a microwave‑oven‑sized furnace generating gas at about 1,000 °C. Launched in June 2025, ForgeStar-1 ran December 2025 tests that showed gas-phase crystal-growth conditions could be created on a free‑flying commercial platform; it was scheduled to deorbit and burn up after further experiments. Space Forge planned ForgeStar-2 to fabricate made‑in‑space semiconductors and return them to Earth, after a £22.6 million Series A round.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“an interaction level of about 1 part in 10,000”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An analysis argued that dark matter and neutrinos interacted, based on cosmic shear measured by the 3-year Dark Energy Survey. The interaction would have altered large-scale structure and lensing; the authors inferred an interaction strength of about one part in 10,000 with ~3σ significance, and suggested it could help resolve the Hubble tension. The result was not definitive; future surveys (e.g. Rubin Observatory) were expected to test it, and confirmation would require revising the standard cosmological model.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;pure muscle.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 2024 scientists announced a new giant anaconda species after a 2022 National Geographic expedition—during which Will Smith, filming Pole to Pole, helped document the find. Accompanied by venom expert Bryan Fry and Waorani guides, Smith's team captured a 16–17‑foot female green anaconda and collected a scale for pollutant and genetic analysis. It was named the northern green anaconda (Eunectes akayama), genetically distinct from Eunectes murinus, with a range in Venezuela, Colombia, Suriname, French Guiana and northern Brazil. The series premiered January 13, 2026.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“'snow drought'”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists said much less winter snow had fallen on the Himalayas, leaving many peaks bare and rocky in a season usually snow-clad. Most winters in the past five years recorded below-average snowfall versus 1980–2020. Warmer temperatures caused faster melt and shifted precipitation from snow to rain at lower elevations, contributing to a reported 'snow drought'. Experts warned declining snowfall and glacier loss would harm water supplies, hydropower, ecosystems, and increase fires, rockfalls, landslides and glacial-lake outbursts.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This galaxy was developing bars 2 billion years after the birth of the Universe.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">University of Pittsburgh graduate student Daniel Ivanov led a team that identified COSMOS-74706 as a spectroscopically confirmed barred spiral galaxy seen about 11.5 billion years ago, roughly 2 billion years after the Big Bang, using JWST data from STScI. Presented at the AAS on Jan. 8, 2026, the finding was more definitive than prior lensing- or redshift-based candidates and helped constrain timescales for early bar formation.</p>

  <p class="dek">NASA's Pandora exoplanet satellite launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Vandenberg on Jan. 11 at 8:44 a.m. EST on the 'Twilight' mission, which delivered 40 payloads to a dusk-dawn sun-synchronous orbit; deployments occurred during a roughly 90-minute window starting about an hour after liftoff. The 716-pound (325 kg) Pandora began a yearlong mission to study at least 20 exoplanets with a 17-inch (45 cm) telescope, using visible and infrared observations to separate stellar variability from planetary atmospheric signals, focusing on water- or hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the transit light source effect”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Jan. 11, 2026 a SpaceX Falcon 9 launched NASA’s Pandora telescope into orbit. Pandora was designed to complement the James Webb Space Telescope by studying host stars in detail to remove stellar contamination that had compromised exoplanet transit spectroscopy. Studies by Rackham, Giampapa and the author had identified the “transit light source effect” — starspots, active regions and stellar water vapor — that could mimic planetary atmospheric signals. NASA’s 2018 plan from Quintana and Barclay initiated Pandora as a rapid solution.</p>

  <p class="dek">NASA returned four Crew-11 astronauts early from the ISS under the first-ever medical evacuation after a medical concern for one crewmember. SpaceX planned to bring commander Zena Cardman, pilot Mike Fincke and mission specialists Kimiya Yui and Oleg Platonov home aboard Dragon Endeavour, undocking Jan. 14 and splashing down Jan. 15. A 3:40 a.m. ET Pacific splashdown off Southern California was favored but the exact San Diego/Oceanside/Los Angeles site depended on weather; SpaceX had shifted to Pacific landings in 2025.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“advanced form factors and cutting-edge technology”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The FCC approved SpaceX’s request to deploy 7,500 additional Gen2 Starlink satellites, allowing 15,000 total, and authorized upgrades to advanced form factors, broader frequency use and extra orbital shells. The changes were said to expand internet and mobile coverage globally, enable direct-to-cell connectivity outside the US and supplemental US coverage, and support SpaceX’s T-Mobile satellite-to-phone services (texts, app access and planned voice). The decision followed SpaceX’s earlier 4,400-satellite altitude reduction and its 2020 29,988-satellite filing.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We have shown how variation in our genetic code can alter how we perceive pain.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">European researchers published in Communications Biology and reported that three Neanderthal-derived variants in the SCN9A gene were linked to greater sensitivity to skin-prick pain after mustard-oil sensitization in modern humans, but not to heat or pressure pain. Carrying all three variants increased sensitivity compared with carrying one. Authors proposed these variants produced more sensitized sensory neurons and suggested Neanderthals may have been more sensitive to certain pains, and they called for further research.</p>
