  <blockquote class="quote">“The skeleton supports a rich benthic fauna”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 2009 researchers found a likely 16-foot gray whale carcass on the Clayoquot Slope about 4,100 feet deep. Ocean Networks Canada and partners revisited in 2012, 2020 and 2023 and documented a persistent, diverse benthic community—gastropods, isopods, crabs, rattail fish and tube worms still on the left jaw—illustrating whale-fall succession through Mobile Scavenger, Enrichment Opportunist and Sulfophilic stages. The 2023 expedition added photogrammetry and time-series data to the site’s dataset.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“They used 60 hours of time on JWST’s NIRSpec instrument and weren't able to definitively confirm the existence of a possible exomoon.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Searching for exomoons had been an anticipated JWST capability but proved difficult. A preprint by David Kipping described 60 hours on JWST’s NIRSpec targeting Kepler-167e; earlier indirect candidates included WASP-39b and W1935. Detector systematics produced light-curve trends on the same timescale as a moon transit. Data were processed through three pipelines and four models (12 combinations); seven combinations hinted at a moon, but alternative explanations prevented confirmation.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;a crucial moment in the exploration – and exploitation – of space&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Guardian reported that Glasgow hosted Space-Comm, one of the UK’s largest space industry gatherings, where about 2,000 leaders from NASA, the UK and Scottish governments and the UK Space Agency met commercial suppliers and policy makers. It noted the ISS was nearing its end, prompting a realignment of missions that could bring states and scientists into conflict. The writer had spoken to Ian Sample about a resurgent, competitive space race and why humans seemed set on returning to the Moon; other headlines were listed.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“SpaceX has now launched 60 missions from California this year.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched its 60th mission from Vandenberg on Dec. 2 (0528 GMT), when a Falcon 9 lifted off carrying 27 Starlink satellites. The first stage (booster B1081, on its 20th flight) landed on the droneship Of Course I Still Love You about 8.5 minutes after liftoff; the upper stage deployed the satellites about 62 minutes later. SpaceflightNow recorded 60 California launches; SpaceX had also flown 94 Falcon 9 missions from Florida and five Starship suborbital tests from Starbase that year.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;gravity described space−time itself&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article reported that modern physics was governed by two frameworks—Einstein’s General Relativity for the very big and quantum theory for the very small—and noted gravity lacked an observed quantum particle (graviton). It described University of London physicists Joseph Aziz and Richard Howl’s Nature paper proposing that classical gravity could still mediate quantum entanglement via virtual processes. It said experiments could distinguish this from true quantum gravity because quantum correlations would be stronger, but practical tests were hampered by decoherence.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Puttalam district in North Western Sri Lanka is currently facing severe flooding, landslides and rockfalls”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Puttalam district in North Western Sri Lanka had experienced severe flooding, landslides and rockfalls caused by heavy monsoon rains. Copernicus Sentinel-2 acquired imagery on 30 November 2025 and one month earlier in false‑colour near‑infrared (sediment green/brown, cleaner water dark blue/black, vegetation red) to show flood extent. Sentinel‑2 comprised two identical satellites with a 13‑band imager at 786 km altitude and five‑day revisit; the Disasters Charter was activated to provide satellite data.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ESA PODCAST UNVEILS SPACE BREAKTHROUGHS</h3>
  
  <p class="dek">ESA’s Discovery and Preparation launched a podcast series that highlighted innovative space technologies developed through its activities. The series explored “blue sky” research projects that pushed boundaries for future missions and commercial applications on Earth. The first episode, on Spotify, featured Gaetan Petit, co‑founder and CEO of Ask Earth, describing the spin‑off’s AI‑native geospatial agent that turned complex Earth‑observation data into actionable insights. Discovery and Preparation provided funding, expertise and support via the Open Space Innovation Platform to researchers, startups and companies across ESA member states.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We are introducing artificial tendons as interchangeable connectors between muscle actuators and robotic skeletons.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT engineers developed artificial tendons from a tough, flexible hydrogel and attached them to lab-grown muscle to create a muscle–tendon unit. When connected to a robotic gripper and the muscle was stimulated, the gripper pinched three times faster and produced 30 times greater force than the same design without tendons. The team proposed using the tendons as interchangeable, modular connectors for various biohybrid robots.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;truly unique weapon&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Russian ICBM fired from an underground silo on the southern steppe during a scheduled test failed shortly after launch and did not reach 4,000 feet, crashing near Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast. Video showed it veering off, cartwheeling, ejecting a component, then exploding in a fireball that produced a reddish-brown hydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide cloud; satellite images showed a crater. Analysts said it was likely an RS-28 Sarmat, a next-generation long-range ICBM with prior failures.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“driving &quot;want&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described neuroscience research that linked individual differences in motivation to brain mechanisms, particularly basal ganglia circuits. It presented a case in which two small strokes caused profound apathy that did not respond to antidepressants but improved after a dopamine-receptor stimulant. Dopamine was said to drive “want” rather than pleasure. Brain scans of students showed that apathetic individuals’ motivation-related regions worked harder when evaluating effort versus reward, implying biological contributions to everyday apathy and potential treatments.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We are talking about 20 to 50 Milky Way diameters placed side by side.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers had discovered 53 new Giant Radio Quasars that blasted jets of matter at near light-speed stretching up to 7.2 million light-years (about 50 times the Milky Way's width). The objects were part of 369 radio quasars identified by Indian researchers in Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) data from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey, which covered about 90% of the sky. The jets created radio lobes from accretion-disk-fed supermassive black holes; about 14% lay in groups, clusters or cosmic filaments.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“While we are focusing on Jupiter, ultimately we are trying to create a theory about water and atmospheric dynamics that can broadly be applied to other planets, including…”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers published a PNAS study that used computer models of Jupiter’s midlatitude water cycle to explain Juno-observed atmospheric irregularities. They proposed Jupiter’s ten-hour rotation drove water to rain into layers beneath the main cloud tops, causing precipitation to increase with depth. They said findings could inform Jupiter’s dynamics, composition, evolution, and how Jupiter may have delivered water to Earth, and be applied to gas-giant exoplanets. Jupiter’s atmosphere was ~0.25% water, ~89% hydrogen and ~10% helium.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“your brain didn’t actually feel pain.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Katherine Cobb‑Pitstick, an assistant professor of child neurology at the University of Pittsburgh, explained that headaches and migraines were common among her pediatric and adolescent patients and that, although the brain did not feel pain, head pain was produced by several interacting factors. She noted that head pain was complicated, researchers still had much to learn, and there were a few key players known to generate pain. She disclosed no relevant conflicts; the university funded membership of The Conversation.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““The earlier closure and relatively small size of this year’s ozone hole is a reassuring sign.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Copernicus reported that the Antarctic ozone hole that year was the smallest and shortest-lived since 2019, peaking at 21m sq km in September and closing early, down from 26m sq km in 2023. It was the second consecutive year of smaller holes after larger 2020–2023 events. Scientists attributed recovery to the Montreal Protocol’s ban on ozone‑depleting substances, noted the Hunga Tonga 2022 eruption may have enlarged recent holes, and cited WMO estimates of recovery to 1980 levels by 2066.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We can now, for the very first time, send a European astronaut flying 360,000 kilometers away.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">At a Nov. 27 ESA ministerial in Bremen, Director General Josef Aschbacher said a German astronaut would be the first European to fly to the moon on a future NASA-led Artemis mission. ESA secured three moon-bound seats in exchange for European contributions, including the European Service Module and Lunar Gateway components. Likely candidates were veterans Matthias Maurer and Alexander Gerst. ESA seats were allocated to Artemis 4 (planned 2028) and Artemis 5 (expected 2030); Artemis 3 aimed to land in 2027.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Sgr B2 is the most massive, and active star-forming region in our galaxy.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIRI on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope captured glowing cosmic dust heated by very young massive stars in the Sagittarius B2 molecular cloud, in unprecedented mid-infrared detail. The image showed colorful stars and bright gas and dust. Sgr B2 was the galaxy’s most massive, active star-forming region a few hundred light‑years from the central supermassive black hole; although it held 10% of the galactic center’s gas, it produced 50% of its stars. Further study of stellar masses and ages aimed to clarify star formation there.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It was warm before the first stars ignited.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article reported that after recombination the Universe entered a roughly billion-year cosmic dark age detectable mainly via the neutral hydrogen 21 cm line. Using a decade of Murchison Widefield Array data to extract the 21 cm power spectrum during the Epoch of Reionization, researchers found hydrogen began warming about 800 million years after the Big Bang — before the first stars ignited. The result ruled out a “cold start” reionization model and suggested heating sources such as x‑rays from early black holes.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">RED GIANT SINGS TO BLACK HOLE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“These vibrations told us something unexpected about this star’s history.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers used NASA's TESS to observe starquakes in the red giant of binary system Gaia BH2, about 3,800 light-years away in Centaurus, discovered by ESA's Gaia in 2023. The oscillations probed the star's interior and indicated a young (~5 billion-year-old) but alpha-rich composition; combined with an unusually rapid 398-day rotation, this suggested past mass accretion or a stellar merger, possibly linked to formation of its black hole companion.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the third ingredient was necessary: cosmic dust.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers from Friedrich Schiller University, the University of Virginia and Heriot-Watt University concluded that cosmic dust had enabled formation of life’s precursor molecules. The James Webb Space Telescope had detected ammonium carbamate in a protoplanetary disk; the salt formed from carbon dioxide and ammonia. In lab experiments, Dr Alexey Potapov replicated −260 °C to −190 °C disk conditions and found the CO2–NH3 reaction proceeded only when cosmic dust was present.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;I was surprised that they were able to get this much done.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers described how reverse mathematics was applied to complexity theory: instead of starting from axioms they substituted a theorem for an axiom and proved the axiom, and used this to show many distinct complexity-theory theorems were exactly equivalent. They situated the work within metamathematics aimed at explaining why longstanding hardness proofs (for problems like the traveling-salesperson problem) had not succeeded. The story began when Lijie Chen studied metamathematics in summer 2022.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the longest earthworks of the pre-mechanical era.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Benin City's ancient walls, ramparts, and ditches were the longest known earthworks of the pre-mechanical era. Built in sections between the 7th and 14th centuries, Benin Iya formed a vast cellular network of moats and ramparts used for defensive, political, and economic boundaries. Archaeology indicated the earthworks spanned more than 16,000 km and enclosed about 6,500 km². Many sections were destroyed or obscured by modern growth, but inner walls near Oredo, Egor, and Ikpoba-Okha appeared in Landsat 9 imagery from January 11, 2025.</p>
