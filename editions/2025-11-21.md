  <blockquote class="quote">“I can just put you on a treatment while I’m waiting...”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Sorfequiline showed stronger activity than existing treatments and a comparable safety profile in a trial that suggested it could boost cure rates and shorten TB treatment by months. TB Alliance researchers reported results at the Union Conference in Copenhagen from a 309‑participant study across 22 sites in South Africa, the Philippines, Georgia, Tanzania and Uganda. All participants had drug‑sensitive TB, though investigators said the drug might also help resistant infections. The WHO reported 10.7 million cases and 1.23 million deaths last year.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The enhancements span propulsion, structures, avionics, reusability and recovery operations”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin announced upgrades to New Glenn after its second mission sent NASA’s ESCAPADE probes and landed the first stage. Enhancements to propulsion, structures, avionics, reusability and recovery would be phased in starting with NG‑3 (expected early next year); BE‑4 and BE‑3U upgrades raised first‑stage thrust from 3.9→4.5 million and upper‑stage from 320,000→400,000 pounds. The company unveiled a super‑heavy New Glenn 9x4 (nine BE‑4s, four BE‑3Us) that could loft 77 tons to LEO with a 28.5‑ft fairing, lower‑cost tanks and improved thermal protection.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It was the 100th liftoff of the year from the Sunshine State.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Falcon 9 launched from Cape Canaveral on Nov. 20 at 10:39 p.m. EST, carrying 29 Starlink satellites. It was the 100th liftoff of the year from Florida. The first stage returned and landed on the droneship Just Read the Instructions about 8.5 minutes after liftoff; booster 1080 flew its 23rd mission. The upper stage deployed satellites about 65 minutes after launch. SpaceX had flown 149 Falcon 9 missions in 2025, over 90 from Florida, and five Starship suborbital tests from South Texas.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;A New Freckle on the Face of the Moon&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers identified a fresh 22‑metre lunar crater by comparing Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter images taken before December 2009 and after December 2012. The impact produced bright rays of ejecta extending tens of metres that contrasted with surrounding regolith; space weathering would gradually darken those rays over thousands to millions of years. The discovery helped refine contemporary impact rates and calibrate crater‑dating models, demonstrating the Moon continued to acquire new scars.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“developed shallower knowledge”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">After ChatGPT’s late-2022 release, Melumad and co-author Jin Ho Yun reported, across seven studies with over 10,000 participants, that learning via large language models produced shallower outcomes than standard Google search. Participants randomly used LLMs or Google to learn topics (e.g., growing a vegetable garden), then wrote advice. LLM users reported learning less, spent less effort, and produced shorter, more generic and less factual advice that independent readers rated as less informative, helpful and adoptable; results proved robust to controls.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“[Our findings suggest] that the ancestry component represented by [the Jesús María individual] is the main Native American lineage in the region up to the present day.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers analyzed DNA from 328 individuals across ten millennia in central Argentina's Pampas and identified an ~8,500-year-old lineage first seen in remains near Jesús María. That ancestry persisted with little genetic change despite later population growth, adoption of agriculture and cultural exchanges; the group remained unusually insular with limited admixture, contrasting Neolithic farmer gene spread elsewhere. Many modern Argentinians carried this ancestry, and genetic homogeneity coexisted with regional language diversity.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">INFANT UNIVERSE BLACK HOLE FEEDS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This discovery is truly remarkable.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using JWST, astronomers uncovered a rapidly feeding supermassive black hole in galaxy CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, seen 570 million years after the Big Bang. NIRSpec spectra showed highly ionized gas around a compact nucleus, indicating an accreting black hole of about 100 million solar masses. Its mass exceeded expectations given the galaxy's stellar mass, implying early black holes may have grown faster than their hosts. CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 was a 'Little Red Dots' object.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Methane combustion didn't generate appreciable soot.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin's New Glenn achieved its first successful landing on Nov. 13 during the NASA ESCAPADE launch; its first stage returned about nine minutes after liftoff, touching down on the drone ship Jacklyn and appeared virtually unscathed. The article explained the cleanliness was due to BE-4 engines burning liquid oxygen and methane (methalox), which produced little soot, unlike kerosene-powered Falcon 9 boosters. The booster was returned to Cape Canaveral LC-36 for inspection and planned reuse.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;A n eclipse happens only on a new moon,&quot; said Lowry.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers concluded that the Dresden Codex eclipse table had been repurposed from earlier lunar-month tables and that Maya daykeepers used an alignment of 405 lunar months (11,960 days) with 46 x 260-day Tzolk'in cycles to keep it accurate over centuries. Justeson and Lowry mathematically modeled pages 51 and 58 and compared results to a NASA eclipse database (145 solar eclipses, 350–1150 CE), finding the table could run from an eighth-century start to the 18th century with occasional adjustments for slippage.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inwards to their present orbits.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reviewed whether sub-Neptune exoplanets could generate water via crust–atmosphere reactions rather than by migration or delivery. Horn et al. published &quot;Building wet planets through high-pressure magma–hydrogen reactions&quot; in Nature and studied 1.5–4 Earth-radius sub-Neptunes with hydrogen–helium envelopes. These planets had been classified as dry or wet; the team noted abundant crustal oxygen and used laboratory experiments to test hydrogen–magma reactions that could form water.</p>

  <p class="dek">NASA progressed toward launching Artemis II, the first crewed Artemis mission planned no later than April next year. Orion was integrated with the SLS in the VAB at Kennedy Space Center. Teams completed end-to-end communications and interface tests with the Near Space and Deep Space Networks. Engineers and the four-person crew prepared with simulations and Countdown Demonstration Tests — including crew boarding in Orion Integrity inside the VAB and pad emergency practice at Launch Pad 39B — for the roughly 10-day lunar mission.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers at Imperial College London and the UK Dementia Research Institute, led by Nir Grossman, recorded EEGs and found that brain activity remained stable until a sudden, drastic drop defined a 'tipping point' marking the wake–sleep cutoff rather than a gradual fade. They defined &quot;sleep distance,&quot; found the average fall-to-sleep interval was 4.5 minutes, observed the occipital cortex fell earlier than the frontal cortex, and used one night’s data to predict future falls within about 49 seconds; results appeared in Nature Neuroscience.</p>

  <p class="dek">After the Deepwater Horizon spill, researcher Iain Kerr converted a chance encounter with whale blow to a drone-based sampler, the SnotBot, which collected blowhole mucus into petri dishes for DNA, sex, pregnancy and microbiome analyses. In the past 10–15 years drones became affordable, reduced boat approaches and disturbance, were safer and cheaper than planes, enabled body-condition measures, tag deployment (including an August 2025 push-on suction-cup method), and revealed new behaviors such as kelp grooming by killer whales.</p>

  <p class="dek">Astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS on 1 July 2025 and tracked it through summer with Earth telescopes but positional uncertainty remained large. ESA repurposed the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter's CaSSIS camera to image the comet between 1–7 October as it passed within 29 million km of Mars, providing a closer, different-angled data point that greatly reduced trajectory uncertainty. Those astrometric measurements were the first from a spacecraft orbiting another planet accepted by the Minor Planet Center and aided planetary-defence preparedness.</p>

  <p class="dek">ESA Mars Express images showed lineated valley fill (LVF) and concentric crater fill (CCF) in Coloe Fossae, which were interpreted as rocky material deposited by glacial ice flows. Scientists said Mars had repeated ice ages driven by long-term obliquity variations that advanced glaciers from the poles into mid-latitudes and later retreated; similar features were found across mid-latitudes. These observations indicated multiple glacial periods as Mars' atmosphere was stripped and surface water disappeared, which helped reconstruct its transition to a cold, dry planet.</p>
