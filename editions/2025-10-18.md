  <h3 class="hed">TIDES IGNITE WHITE DWARF FIRE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The tides it seems, are indeed changing for white dwarfs.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Most white dwarf binaries had cooled to about 4,000 K, but a peculiar class with orbital periods under an hour exhibited surface temperatures of 10,000–30,000 K and radii about twice predicted. McNeill's team at Kyoto developed a tidal‑heating model showing mutual tidal deformation converted orbital energy into internal heat, inflating the larger companion and accelerating contact and mass transfer. Such systems (e.g., J0806, 321‑s period) were expected to emit gravitational waves and could affect Type Ia progenitors; the team planned tests on carbon–oxygen binaries.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MARS ICE MAY HARBOR ANCIENT LIFE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We studied radiolytic degradation of the individual amino acids (glycine, alanine, and isovaline) in icy mixtures.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that Mars' subsurface ice, revealed by Phoenix and orbiters and enough to yield 1.5 meters of liquid water, could have preserved amino acids or microbes for up to 50 million years. In lab experiments published in Astrobiology, lead author Alexander Pavlov froze E. coli in water and regolith analogs and irradiated samples at −51 °C to simulate 50 million years. Amino acids degraded more slowly in pure ice than in silicates, implying a rover with a digging tool could detect preserved organics.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">TESLA MAD MAX DEFIES SPEED LAWS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It hasn’t been out for 24 hours, and it has already been spotted rolling stop signs and driving more than 15 mph (24 km/h) over the speed limit.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Tesla reintroduced a Full Self-Driving mode called 'Mad Max' that offered higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than the Hurry mode. The mode had originally been part of Autopilot in 2018. Electrek reported it was seen within 24 hours rolling stop signs and driving more than 15 mph (24 km/h) over the limit. The US NHTSA had opened an investigation into FSD after receiving over 50 reports. The article described the reintroduction as comically bad, dangerous, and arrogant.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Jettison is complete.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Two Russian cosmonauts returned inside the ISS after a 6-hour, 9-minute spacewalk Oct. 16, when Expedition 73 commander Sergey Ryzhikov and flight engineer Alexey Zubritsky installed the Ekran‑M (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) semiconductor experiment on the Nauka module via the European Robotic Arm, ran power and fitted a swappable cassette. They then removed and jettisoned an obsolete 82‑kg HDTV camera from Zvezda that would burn on reentry, cleaned a window, and retrieved exposed material samples. It was Zubritsky's first EVA and Ryzhikov's second.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““It’s a pretty big bet.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A startup called General Intuition spun out from gaming-clip platform Medal after founder Pim de Witte found AI labs valued Medal’s data for training world models. Medal reportedly received multiple acquisition offers, including an alleged $500 million bid from OpenAI, and handled about 2 billion video uploads per year from thousands of games. General Intuition raised a $133.7 million seed round led by Vinod Khosla, and aimed to use gaming data to train agents with spatial, 3D understanding.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">APOLLO 17 ROCKS SHOW UV-SCARRED SULFUR</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“we saw values that are very different from anything we find on Earth.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Samples from a helium-sealed Apollo 17 double drive tube were analyzed by a Brown University-led team (James W. Dottin III, with collaborators at UNM and WHOI) under NASA's ANGSA program and published in JGR: Planets. Using secondary ion mass spectrometry, they found lunar mantle-derived rocks with sulfur highly depleted in 33S relative to Earth. The results were interpreted as possibly reflecting sulfur interaction with ultraviolet radiation in the Moon's early, short-lived atmosphere.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AUSTRALIAN RAINFORESTS BECOME CARBON SOURCES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Current models may overestimate the capacity of tropical forests to help offset fossil fuel emissions.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Australia's tropical rainforests had become net carbon sources rather than sinks, a study in Nature found. Using 49 years of data from 20 Queensland forests, researchers led by Dr Hannah Carle reported that extreme temperatures, drought, atmospheric drying and more frequent, severe cyclones increased tree deaths and reduced growth, which caused woody biomass to shift to net emissions about 25 years ago. The authors warned this could mean models overestimated tropical forests' ability to offset fossil‑fuel emissions.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AI UNVEILS HIDDEN HEART SOUNDS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“audible symptoms of disease often appeared only at later stages of illness.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Authors from Florida International University described that the stethoscope had been used for over 200 years as an accessible, cost‑effective tool to amplify internal body sounds and to screen for heart or lung disease. They noted that audible symptoms of disease often appeared only at later stages of illness, which limited treatment effectiveness—particularly for heart disease, where sound changes were not always clearly defined or easy to hear. Funding came from foundation grants and the NIH.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ROBOT FAILS, SCIENTIST UNCOVERS FLY PERSONALITIES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“MAPLE did not work.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Shraddha Lall, a Harvard Ph.D. candidate and AAAS Mass Media Science Fellow, measured individual differences in fruit fly behavior by transferring anesthetized flies into simple mazes with a paintbrush and tracked 900 flies daily. She had planned to automate handling with her lab robot MAPLE but it failed on day one of a planned 500-day experiment, so she manually continued for 18 months, encountering obstacles and learning about the behavioral building blocks of personality and practical research challenges.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">GOOGLE'S VEO 3.1 TRANSFORMS IMAGES TO MOVIES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“better &quot;prompt adherence&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google released Veo 3.1, an update to its Veo video-generation model available via the Gemini API and powering the Flow editor. It improved prompt adherence, allowed converting images to video with simultaneous audio generation, and enabled Flow's Frame to Video feature (uploading first and last frames to generate the in-between). Audio also applied when extending clips or inserting objects. Shared samples still looked uncanny and varied by prompt; Veo 3.1 was less realistic than OpenAI's Sora 2 but aimed to be more useful for video work.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;the weather was more the challenge.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astrophotographer Josh Dury captured Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) over Somerset on Oct. 12, showing a bright green coma and long diffuse tail ahead of its close approach to Earth on Oct. 21. He photographed it from the Mendip Hills with a Sony A7S III while contending with haze, mist, fog and high winds; a pink aurora appeared near the horizon. The comet was about magnitude +4.9, was expected to brighten before its approach and then fade for over a thousand years beyond Neptune.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“it’ll include three sections with a combined capacity of 960 megawatts”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Amazon shared renders and details of a proposed Cascade Advanced Energy Facility in Richland, Washington, as part of a prior agreement with Energy Northwest to support up to 12 advanced small modular reactors by the early 2030s. The first plant would have three sections totaling 960 MW, occupy only a few city blocks, create about 100 permanent and 1,000+ construction jobs, and construction was not expected until the end of the decade.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">LITTLE RED DOTS HARBOR TITAN SEEDS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“On the Fate of Little Red Dots”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">After JWST's December 2022 survey revealed compact &quot;Little Red Dots&quot; (LRDs), astronomers debated whether they were dusty, intensely star-forming &quot;stellar-only&quot; galaxies or early AGNs hosting massive black holes. LRDs were unusually compact (~100 pc), very red, and had broad Balmer lines implying high velocity dispersions; but most lacked strong X-rays and would host overmassive black holes (~10% of galaxy mass versus 0.1% locally). Escala et al. concluded LRDs began as stellar-only systems that later seeded supermassive black holes.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">VANDENBERG BRACES FOR ROCKET STAMPEDE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“up to 95 missions using the Falcon 9 rocket and up to five launches of the larger Falcon Heavy.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Department of the Air Force approved SpaceX’s plan to launch up to 100 missions per year from Vandenberg Space Force Base, authorizing up to 95 Falcon 9 and five Falcon Heavy launches after releasing a final EIS and signing a Record of Decision on October 10. The FAA would decide on commercial increases; the California Coastal Commission had rejected SpaceX’s proposal. Authorization also allowed redevelopment of SLC-6 to support Falcon 9/Heavy, including demolitions and two new booster landing pads; SpaceX currently used SLC-4E.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Flight Test 11 achieved all of its mission goals”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched the 11th Starship test flight on Oct. 12, and Flight Test 11 achieved all mission objectives. The Ship upper stage descended and soft-landed in the Indian Ocean, while the Super Heavy booster hovered briefly above the Gulf of Mexico before plunging into the sea. It was the booster's second flight and one of only two reflown. The mission deployed Starlink mass simulators, relit Ship's Raptor engines, and tested a new Super Heavy landing-burn initiation sequence; Starship V2 completed its final flight.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ANTARCTICA NEARS GREENLAND MELTDOWN</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The Larsen B ice shelf collapse in 2002 was a staggering event in our community.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">As recently as the 1990s Antarctica had seemed stable compared with a thawing Arctic, but researchers reported that it had become similarly vulnerable. Satellite and field observations documented increased surface melting, faster glacier flow, collapsing ice shelves and reduced sea ice. Scientists warned that a Greenland-like meltdown could accelerate sea-level rise and alter rainfall and drought patterns. The Antarctic ice sheet covered about 5.4 million square miles, averaged over 1 mile thick, held 61% of Earth’s fresh water, enough to raise sea level ~190 feet.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“opt in to autonomous delivery”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Waymo partnered with DoorDash to run autonomous deliveries in Phoenix, initially limited to orders from DoorDash's DashMart. Customers had to opt in to autonomous delivery at checkout and collect orders from the car's trunk. Waymo had run a similar Uber Eats program in 2024. The company operated Waymo One robotaxis and worked with partners like Uber; it had abandoned 2020 long‑haul truck plans in 2023 to focus on robotaxis and the Waymo Driver, and these tests suggested interest in smaller-scale deliveries.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;It felt like I was watching the sandworms in the film 'Dune,'&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at Utrecht University simulated Martian dunes and showed that blocks of CO2 ice formed in winter sublimated as temperatures rose, trapping gas that vented and propelled the slabs downslope. In a Mars chamber the moving blocks plowed narrow trenches and pushed sand into small levees, reproducing sinuous gullies seen from orbit. The experiment offered a water-free explanation for gully formation. Findings were published Oct. 8 in Geophysical Research Letters.</p>
