  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Autonomous&quot; option in the Uber app”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Uber and WeRide deployed fully autonomous robotaxis in Abu Dhabi, offering a driverless option for UberX and Uber Comfort riders in designated areas after an initial 2024 launch with safety drivers. The service ran in a 12-square-mile Yas Island tourist zone where users could select the &quot;Autonomous&quot; option (which did not guarantee a driverless vehicle). Vehicles were WeRide's five-place GXR (based on Geely's Farizon SuperVan) with more than 20 sensors; Uber managed fleet operations with Tawasul and planned expansion to 15 more cities.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“STO was the obvious choice. When we tried it, surprisingly, it matched our expectations perfectly.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Stanford-led team reported in Science that strontium titanate (STO) preserved and improved its optical and mechanical properties near absolute zero, outperforming existing cryogenic materials. STO combined strong electric-field tunable photonic effects and piezoelectricity, maintained operation down to −238°F, and was easy to manufacture. Its optical response was 40 times stronger than other materials, it exceeded lithium niobate by 20× and barium titanate by 3×, and oxygen-isotope substitution further enhanced superconductivity-related performance.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the chemistry for life occurs naturally in space.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Since the 1950s searches used probes, meteorite analysis, radio telescopes and UFO investigations. Studies found the Murchison meteorite contained all five nucleobases and the Orgueil meteorite held amino acids and microfossil‑like structures, both confirmed extraterrestrial. Spacecraft detected water on Mars and glaciers on Enceladus; radio telescopes found over a hundred organic molecules in interstellar clouds, supporting panspermia. No confirmed intelligent extraterrestrial life emerged; many UFOs were explained. New AI tools were applied to distinguish biological from non‑biological organics and to analyse signals and biosignatures.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“11,686 photographs taken by drone”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article reported that Rapa Nui (Easter Island) hosted nearly 1,000 moai carved between 1200 and 1700 and had long attracted mysterious explanations. Archaeologists had proposed chiefs, elite control, sleds, rollers and rails, often without direct archaeological linkage. Carl Lipo, who had researched the island for over two decades, and colleagues used 11,686 drone photographs to create a centimetre-resolution 3D model of Rano Raraku (where 95% of moai were carved) to generate testable predictions about production organization.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the changes in solar energy every two to three million years kept in step with the ups and downs in observed oxygen levels.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A study used a climate and biogeochemical model to suggest that periodic changes in Earth's orbit altered solar energy every two to three million years, matching observed oxygen pulses during the Cambrian. Those solar-energy-induced climate shifts increased high-latitude weathering, releasing nutrient bursts that boosted ocean photosynthesis and oxygen, which fuelled rapid evolutionary diversification. Similar orbital cycles occurred at other times, but only the Cambrian combined the necessary conditions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a white dwarf radiating at an incredible 250,000 degrees Celsius”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Gemini South marked its 25th anniversary with a new image of the Butterfly Nebula (NGC 6302), chosen by Chilean students. Astronomers estimated the nebula lay 2,500–3,800 light-years away and featured a central white dwarf radiating about 250,000 °C; the progenitor had become a red giant and shed its outer layers. Slower equatorial ejecta formed a dusty belt, faster perpendicular outflows made the wings, and radiation heated and ionized the gas. Gemini South operated atop Cerro Pachón as part of the International Gemini Observatory.</p>

  <p class="dek">On Oct. 20, 2025, NASA’s Artemis II Orion spacecraft with its launch abort system was stacked atop the agency’s SLS rocket in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion was planned to carry NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut Jeremy Hansen on a 10-day mission around the Moon and back in early 2026; the public was directed to follow the mission on the NASA Artemis blog.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MATHEMATICIAN PROPOSES WORMHOLE FROM BLACK HOLES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“To build a wormhole, you need a very unusual kind of matter that has negative energy-density.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Farook Rahaman and Arya Dutta presented a mathematical scenario, accepted for publication, in which a wormhole could be formed by 'cutting and pasting' two black holes inside a prepared Kalb–Ramond tensor field with a nonzero vacuum expectation value that broke Lorentz symmetry. They explained that exotic negative-energy-density matter was placed at the junction, producing a wormhole whose stability depended on throat size and hypothetical parameters; it was unstable under standard values but could be stable if those values were altered.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">TIDAL HEAT BOILS MOON OCEANS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“ice occupies more volume than liquid.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers led by Max Rudolph at UC Davis found that when ice shells on small icy moons melted from below, the denser liquid reduced ocean pressure enough to trigger decompression boiling at water's triple point. Calculations showed moons like Mimas, Enceladus and Miranda could have experienced such boiling during tidal-heating-driven shell thinning, explaining features like Miranda's coronae and Enceladus's tiger stripes, while larger moons such as Titania would have cracked before boiling, affecting ocean stability and habitability assessments.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a dozen sites that were associated with behavioral differences in both humans and dogs.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers performed the largest gene–behavior association study within a single breed, scanning genomes from over 1,000 golden retrievers in the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study and using owners' behavior surveys. They tested 14 behavioral traits, finding 12 genomic regions strongly associated and nine weaker signals. Many regions matched human loci linked to behavioral differences, though often to different behaviors (e.g., dog fear vs human neuroticism; ROMO1: dog training vs human cognitive performance and depression). The study suggested conserved gene functions but divergent behavioral outcomes.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We used a new method to work out the cause of a swarm of earthquakes.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that magma movement beneath Santorini caused a monthlong seismic swarm beginning 27 January 2025, producing about 25,000 earthquakes up to roughly magnitude 5. Studies in Nature and Science concluded magma had risen from the deep crust into a chamber; UCL researchers found vertically oriented magma sheets at ~10 km depth propagated horizontally through ~20 km of rock like a knife scraping bread, reached a reservoir linking Santorini and Kolumbo, but lacked the force to erupt.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“There were a thousand ways that a launch can go wrong and only one way that it can go right.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX scrubbed a Nov. 26 launch of 140 satellites aboard a used Falcon 9 from Vandenberg Space Force Base just over 15 minutes before liftoff; the company did not disclose a reason. The Transporter-15 rideshare was rescheduled for Nov. 28 at 1:19 p.m. EST (1819 GMT) after repeated delays. Payloads included Planet Labs' 36 SuperDoves, ESA's pair of HydryoGNSS, Varda’s W-5 and dozens of other spacecraft; the first stage had flown 29 times and was to land on drone ship &quot;Of Course I Still Love You&quot;.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“No such devices have been built before. The mission aims to fill a critical gap.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Hong Kong proposed Yueshan, a lunar orbiter that would have provided the first continuous, long-term monitoring of meteoroid impacts (transient lunar phenomena). Its Hong Kong-built optical telescope was designed to quantify impact frequency, locations and sizes to assess risks to lunar infrastructure; manufacturing and testing involved partners and Chinese launch interest. The mission complemented ESA’s LUMIO and NASA monitoring, tied to Chang’e-7/8 and Tianwen-3, and targeted 2028 orbit to inform human safety after LRO’s 2014 impact example.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Sentinel-5 is a very powerful European mission to observe our atmosphere.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Sentinel-5A, launched on MetOp-SG-A1 in August 2025, returned first images a little over three months later, producing a global ozone map (captured 13 October), nitrogen dioxide maps over the Middle East and South Africa, formaldehyde over parts of Africa, and sulphur dioxide from a Russian volcano. The polar sun-synchronous satellite at 832 km operated a seven-band imaging spectrometer measuring multiple trace gases and aerosols; the mission was in commissioning and two additional Sentinel-5 instruments were planned to extend lifetime beyond 20 years.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“very large rolls”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using an enhanced radar technique, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) revisited a feature beneath about 1,500 m of south polar ice and concluded that an area once interpreted as an underground lake was more likely a layer of rock and dust. The Geophysical Research Letters paper, led by SHARAD scientists Gareth Morgan and Than Putzig, described use of a 120° spacecraft roll on May 26 to boost SHARAD sensitivity across a ~20 km target; the method could aid future subsurface searches.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““Currently there is military satellite capability sitting on the ground due to Vulcan delays,””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">United Launch Alliance had projected up to 20 launches in 2025 but closed the year with six flights — five Atlas V missions and a single Vulcan flight on August 12 (Vulcan’s third flight and first certified national‑security mission). ULA had trimmed its forecast to nine earlier; Pentagon officials had warned that satellites sat grounded due to Vulcan delays. Two military Vulcan missions were moved to 2026. Amazon’s Kuiper and the Space Force comprised about 90% of ULA’s backlog, with numerous Vulcan reservations.</p>
