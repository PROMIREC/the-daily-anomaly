  <blockquote class="quote">“100,000 vehicles over time, beginning in 2027”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NVIDIA entered a partnership with Uber to equip more rideshare vehicles with its autonomous driving infrastructure, centered on the Drive AGX Hyperion 10 platform and Drive software. The deal aimed to grow Uber's global autonomous fleet to 100,000 vehicles over time, beginning in 2027. Stellantis, Lucid and Mercedes-Benz worked to support NVIDIA's L4 technology, while Aurora, Volvo Autonomous Solutions and Waabi pursued Drive AGX Hyperion 10 implementations for long-haul freight.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“extremely dangerous and life-threatening”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Hurricane Melissa, described by the US National Hurricane Center as creating &quot;extremely dangerous and life-threatening&quot; conditions in Jamaica, was one of the strongest Atlantic storms recorded. The article stated that climate change was not thought to increase the number of tropical cyclones globally but that warmer oceans and atmosphere had the potential to make them more intense, producing higher winds, heavier rainfall and greater coastal flooding. It explained that tropical cyclones formed over warm tropical waters and began as atmospheric disturbances.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“an invisible force”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Stanford Medicine scientists reported a device, Electro-LEV, that used electromagnetic levitation to sort living cells without physical contact. It sorted cells by density and magnetic susceptibility in a paramagnetic flow between opposing magnets, allowing cells to suspend at an equilibrium height. The approach avoided labels or centrifugation, reduced sample stress, and could separate cancerous from healthy or live from dead cells. The work built on Durmus's earlier magnetic-levitation research and was described in PNAS.</p>

  <p class="dek">Expedition 73 commander Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky completed a second spacewalk on Oct. 28, spending 6 hours 54 minutes installing experiments and maintaining the Nauka module. They used the Strela boom to attach a support for the Impuls pulse-plasma and IPI-500 ionosphere experiments, cleaned a window, repaired the Ekran-M molecular-beam epitaxy unit by extracting a loose gasket and inserting a replacement cassette, relocated an ERA control panel, and withheld jettisoning gear because of the approaching HTV-X.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Beam could help military families feel like they were in the same room.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google teamed with the United Service Organizations (USO) to pilot Google Beam, its 3D video-communication system, at USO service centers in the US and other countries starting in 2026. Google suggested Beam could make military families feel like they were in the same room. First shown in 2021 as Project Starline, Beam combined 3D imaging, spatial audio and adaptive lighting, was aimed at enterprise customers, and its initial device cost $25,000.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“CO-dark molecular gas”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers had long relied on CO to trace cold molecular hydrogen but found substantial star-forming gas invisible to CO. Kimberly Emig's team used the Green Bank Telescope to map CO-dark molecular gas across Cygnus X (about 5,000 light-years), surveying over 100 times the full Moon. Low-frequency Carbon Radio Recombination Lines revealed arcs, ridges and turbulent flows, showed brightness correlated with starlight, and identified this material as an intermediate stage toward dense molecular clouds.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;each unleashed the energy of a million hydrogen bombs.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In May 2024 part of the Sun exploded: tangled magnetic fields snapped, producing solar flares that unleashed the energy of a million hydrogen bombs. Segments of the magnetic field broke free as coronal mass ejections—magnetic bubbles carrying billions of tons of plasma—that raced at about 6,000 times a commercial jetliner and struck Earth’s magnetic field days later, producing auroras and powerful electrical currents in the crust. Because the CME and Earth magnetic orientations did not align, most plasma sailed into deep space. Dagomar Degroot had received NASA funding.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The X-59 has finally taken flight.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The X-59, NASA's experimental jet designed to break the sound barrier without loud sonic booms, made its first flight Oct. 28, taking off from Palmdale Regional Airport at 10:13 a.m. EDT after taxiing from USAF Plant 42. NASA did not announce the flight; spotters posted photos and videos showing the aircraft climbing and flying racetrack patterns over Edwards AFB for just over an hour. The Lockheed Martin-built X-59 was moved to Armstrong for microphone and sensor testing to validate quiet supersonic performance.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“in-situ resource utilisation”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Studies traced habitat concepts since 1952 and reported that lunar and Martian settlements had to shield occupants from extreme temperature swings, vacuum, radiation, micrometeorites and dust storms. Early ideas used inflatable fabric; later designs used rigid trusses and deployables. Hybrid approaches paired inflatable modules with protective shells made from local regolith via 3D printing and robotic construction to reduce launch mass. Dome geometries were efficient, and the review concluded that engineering advances had brought permanent settlements closer to reality.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Traditionally, paleoanthropologists believed that Homo habilis, as the earliest big-brained humans, was responsible for the earliest sites with tools.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An article reported that almost 2 million years ago a young human died beside a spring in what is now Tanzania; its 1960-discovered bones were used to define Homo habilis. Authors noted at least three early Homo species (habilis, rudolfensis, erectus) and archaeological sites dated 2.6–1.8 million years ago showed tool use and planning (for example, tools transported ~13 km). Traditionally H. habilis was credited with early tool sites, but recent discoveries and AI analyses of predator-chewed bones made that view shaky.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We found that planets starting with large initial reservoirs of water and located at considerable distances from their host stars are more likely to retain their oceans.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers modeled whether first-generation, water-rich rocky planets could retain oceans while migrating inward as their Sun-like hosts became white dwarfs. They calculated planetary effective temperatures, water evaporation from increased XUV radiation, and effects of planetary scattering and tidal heating. They found Earth- or Mars-sized worlds needed much larger water inventories or initial orbits much farther out; close orbits around hot white dwarfs would fully evaporate water. Late migration after white-dwarf cooling improved ocean retention, making white dwarfs potential astrobiology targets.</p>

  <p class="dek">In 2025 WIRED reported that hundreds of millions used AI and trillions of dollars funded it, and that the conversation shifted from what AI could be to what it was. Large language models were now everywhere — in schools, homes, therapist couches, and government computers. People fed them data and secrets while the world ran a largely unregulated live experiment whose outcomes ranged from transformative best to worst cases. WIRED offered 17 readings to make sense of it.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a shroud of hot dust”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Webb’s NIRCam image of NGC 6537 (the Red Spider Nebula) revealed unprecedented detail and thousands of background stars. The planetary nebula’s central star was visible and, while faint and blue in optical images, appeared red in the near-infrared due to a shroud of hot dust, likely a disc; a hidden companion could explain the nebula’s hourglass (narrow waist, wide outflows) shape. Webb showed closed, bubble-like H2 lobes about three light-years across and an ionised-iron 'S' jet. Data came from GO programme #4571 (PI J. Kastner).</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the space JTAC would connect tactical, on-the-ground SOF units with space assets”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Retired U.S. Army Col. Kevin Stringer and Norwegian officer Marius Kristiansen argued that the U.S. should create Space Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (SJTACs). SJTACs would embed with special operations tactical units to coordinate space-based strikes, assess vulnerabilities, provide real-time targeting and situational awareness, and help employ future space weapons (lasers, EMPs, or kinetic &quot;Rods from God&quot;). They would belong to a Space Force special-operations component.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“it's made with information.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">While studying quantum computers' information storage, Florian Neukart (Leiden University; Terra Quantum AG) proposed that the universe itself stored quantum information. He argued information was an additional contributor to spacetime curvature and promoted a Quantum Memory Matrix in which spacetime comprised Planck‑scale cells (≈1.616255×10−35 m) that stored information. He and others in information physics suggested this framework could illuminate the simulation hypothesis and possibly explain dark matter and dark energy; axions remained a leading undetected dark‑matter candidate.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“no earlier than July 2026.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astrobotic's Griffin-1 lunar lander launch on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy slipped from late 2025 to no earlier than July 2026. Griffin, carrying NASA and commercial payloads including Astrobotic's CubeRover, Astrolab's FLIP rover and small items like the Nippon Travel Agency plaque, had been undergoing payload integration, software, propulsion and avionics testing with core assembly nearly complete and four propellant tanks pending installation. The mission followed Peregrine Mission One's January 2024 failure and was part of NASA's CLPS program.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““The regulation of protein-protein interactions is really key.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Many protein-based medicines were fragile and could lose effectiveness if they aggregated or degraded. An international team from MIT, EPFL and the Southern University of Science and Technology reported open-access findings in Nature that developed a general theory for how free amino acids stabilized proteins, guiding their use to improve drug longevity. They found free amino acids regulated protein–protein interactions; adding proline to insulin doubled its effectiveness in the bloodstream. Alfredo Alexander-Katz was co-corresponding author.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We still remain too fragmented to guarantee Europe with genuine, comprehensive and autonomous space resilience.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">At a Brussels conference, EU Commissioner Andrius Kubilius and ESA argued that space could support security. Organised by ESA and ESPI under the Danish EU‑Council presidency with European Commission support, ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher presented European Resilience from Space programme, an optional scheme to be proposed in Bremen (26–27 Nov 2025) and opened for member‑state subscriptions at the next ESA Ministerial; it would integrate remote sensing, connectivity, PNT, spectrum monitoring and IoT to deliver secure, dual‑use Earth‑observation services linked to the EU MFF 2028–2034.</p>

  <p class="dek">The European Space Agency established its first Asian presence in Tokyo, placing a staff member at X-NIHONBASHI to reinforce ties with Japan, deepen cooperation with JAXA and engage Japan’s space ecosystem. Announced by Eric Morel de Westgaver at Nihonbashi Space Week, ESA framed the move after its November 2024 Tokyo visit and the Joint Statement on Next Big Cooperations. The Tokyo office, at X-NIHONBASHI Tower, was intended to support joint missions, on-site coordination and commercial engagement.</p>

  <p class="dek">A University of Chicago-led team catalogued galactic superclusters using six years of Dark Energy Survey images from Chile and analysed cluster counts and distributions to probe dark matter, dark energy and the S8 tension on cosmic structure. Earlier weak-lensing studies had suggested less structure than Lambda-CDM predicted, but the new cluster analysis found measurements aligned with Lambda-CDM after accounting for biases such as overlapping clusters. Sixty-six scientists from over fifty institutions contributed, and Rubin and Roman telescopes were expected to expand such maps.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Display design should be guided by the limits of human vision, not just by packing in more pixels.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">University of Cambridge scientists, working with Meta Reality Labs, performed experiments that found most people could not distinguish ultra-high-resolution 4K or 8K TVs from lower-pixel HDTVs at typical viewing distances and average screen sizes, though differences were visible when viewers sat very close or screens were exceptionally large. They used a sliding 27&quot; 4K Eizo LCD and a pixels-per-degree metric, did not test OLED/QLED, and suggested results could guide resolution needs for TVs, phones, AR/VR and automotive displays.</p>

  <p class="dek">NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) captured on Oct. 28 an image from its Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) that resembled a cosmic jack-o'-lantern, with dark coronal holes and bright active regions forming eyes, a nose and a smile. The 'mouth' was a vast coronal hole emitting a high-speed solar wind toward Earth, which forecasters said could cause G1–G2 geomagnetic storms Oct. 28–29 and push auroras into mid-latitudes. SDO had monitored the Sun continuously since 2010 and previously saw a similar face in 2014.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;The time required for purification using the crystallization method is around four hours, compared to that required for the chromatography method, which is about 37 to 40 hours.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers reported a crystallization-based purification method that separated full from empty adeno-associated virus capsids, cell debris and other impurities in one step. The method relied on a slight electrical-potential difference between full and empty capsids, reduced processing time from about 37–40 hours to roughly four hours, improved purity and lowered product loss compared with chromatography, and was projected to cut gene-therapy manufacturing costs five- to tenfold. The results were published in ACS Nano by Vivekananda Bal, Richard Braatz and colleagues.</p>
