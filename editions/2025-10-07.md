  <blockquote class="quote">“a shiny new layer just 80 nanometers thick”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Nightly dust in Chile's Atacama Desert had settled on the Very Large Telescope's mirrors, degrading reflectivity, so technicians regularly recoated and polished them. They sometimes sprayed frozen carbon monoxide for light cleaning; eventually the thin aluminum layer had been removed chemically and replaced after engineers removed and checked the 25-ton mirror. The new coating measured about 80 nanometers thick. The image was taken at the VLT basecamp at Cerro Paranal. The VLT had produced detailed observations, including exoplanet imaging and probing supermassive black hole environments.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Arc delivers a transportation capability that has never existed before.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Oct. 1, California-based Inversion unveiled Arc, a reusable, autonomous 8-by-4-foot spacecraft intended as an orbital storehouse and to deliver mission-critical cargo anywhere on Earth in less than an hour, including for U.S. military use. Arc was designed for parachute-aided pinpoint touchdowns and could maneuver above 20 times the speed of sound as a hypersonic testbed. Its predecessor Ray reached orbit but failed to reenter; Arc's first mission was scheduled for 2026 after structural builds, drop tests, modeling and a NASA thermal-protection partnership.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The colours on a butterfly’s wings are not trivial”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers in Brazil documented that as rich tropical forests were replaced by eucalyptus monocultures and other degraded landscapes, butterfly wing colours became more muted. Bright hues had evolved to aid survival through mate attraction, camouflage and signalling, but in stripped, monochrome plantations drab species benefitted. Eucalyptus sites were warmer, drier and flooded with direct light compared with cooler, humid mature forests. The preliminary findings formed part of broader research into “discoloration”.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Pasha has done some brilliant work... But this is next-level stuff for me.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A 2024 proof by Pavel (Pasha) Galashin showed that origami folding patterns could be translated into points forming the amplituhedron, linking paper folding and particle-collision geometry. He used this connection to resolve a long-standing conjecture that the amplituhedron could be decomposed into simpler building blocks corresponding to physicists' calculations. The result connected disparate fields, helped mathematicians study the amplituhedron, and related to scattering-amplitude methods such as Feynman diagrams and BCFW recursion.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The stripe in the Navcam image must have resulted from stacking hundreds of Navcam images over a total time interval of about 10 minutes.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Perseverance's Right Navcam captured a streak of light above Mars on Oct. 4, coinciding with interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS's closest approach to Mars (Oct. 3, 18.6 million miles/30 million km). NASA and JPL had not confirmed the object's identity amid a U.S. government shutdown, though NASA had listed Perseverance among assets slated to observe 3I/ATLAS. Social-media claims of an alien craft were disputed; Avi Loeb said the stripe resulted from stacking many Navcam images over about 10 minutes.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The ancient architects likely raised the stones from the pyramid center in a volcano fashion”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists concluded in a preprint that the 4,500-year-old Step Pyramid of Djoser had internal architecture consistent with a hydraulic elevation mechanism that could have lifted oversized stone blocks from the pyramid's interior in a volcano fashion using water pressure. Watershed mapping suggested the nearby Gisr el-Mudir acted as a check dam creating a temporary lake and Dry Moat linking a Nile tributary, and a rock-cut linear structure resembled settling, retention, and purification basins.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“in a brilliant state of preservation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Sir Ernest Shackleton's 1915 ship Endurance became trapped by Weddell Sea pack ice and sank; the crew survived. Popular belief held Endurance was the strongest polar ship and that a broken rudder caused her loss. A new analysis by Jukka Tuhkuri, informed by the 2022 Endurance22 wreck survey and high-resolution photogrammetry, concluded the vessel was crushed by cumulative compressive ice forces and would have sunk with an intact rudder; it had not been designed for such forces and Shackleton was likely aware.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Illusions are fun, but they are also a gateway to perception.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers from UC Berkeley, the Allen Institute and Seoul National University identified a population of visual-cortex neurons—dubbed IC-encoders—that represented illusory contours such as the Kanizsa triangle. They recorded hundreds to thousands of cells with high-density silicon probes and calcium imaging, then used holographic 3D optogenetic stimulation to selectively activate the ~20 most responsive neurons among ~5,000. Photo-stimulating those IC-encoders recreated neural activity patterns of illusory edges even without visual input, providing a causal link.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described a paper by Professor David Kipping that challenged the Copernican Principle for red-dwarf systems. It reviewed exoplanet discoveries around red dwarfs and noted debate over their habitability. Kipping argued that, given the age of the Universe and the relative rarity of a Sun-like star, red-dwarf planets were unlikely to host observers like humans and that searches there might be misplaced. It noted Kipping's Columbia affiliation and Cool Worlds Lab focus.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“3 astrophysicists explain how particles coming from the Sun interact with Earth”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Three Smithsonian astrophysicists explained solar storms and the solar wind and how particles from the Sun interacted with Earth. The authors—Yeimy J. Rivera, Tatiana Niembro and Samuel Badman—were supported by NASA’s Parker Solar Probe project via the SAO/SWEAP subcontract 975569; Niembro also received LWS grant 80NSSC23K0897. The Smithsonian Institution provided funding as a member of The Conversation US. The article was published in the Curious Kids series and included DOI and contact information.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the Draconids are best in the early evening”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">October marked the start of the autumn and winter meteor season and featured the Draconids. The shower was observer-friendly because its radiant was highest at dusk, so it peaked early evening; a chart showed the view from London at 20:00 BST on 8 October. Under dark skies observers typically saw about 10 slow, graceful meteors per hour, but a waning moon would wash out faint ones. Comet 21P/Giacobini–Zinner had passed close to the Sun in March, raising the chance of a storm of hundreds per hour.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">EARTH'S BREAKNECK JOURNEY GOES UNNOTICED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“you don't even feel the Earth moving”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article explained that Earth had been rotating on its axis (~1,000 mph at the equator) and orbiting the Sun (~67,000 mph), yet people had not felt the motion because it was remarkably steady and lacked sudden jolts. As Earth traveled its slightly oval-shaped path, its speed changed a bit but so gradually it was imperceptible. The author compared this to a cruising airplane: everything moved together, so occupants felt calm and still.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The things left before 2000 are still the majority of the problem.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A new list identified 50 LEO objects that were most likely to generate additional debris and was dominated by pre-2000 relics; 88% were rocket bodies. They orbited at about 700–1,000 km and traveled near 5 miles per second. Russia/Soviet Union held 34 entries and China 10. Analysts estimated removing all 50 would have reduced debris-generating potential by 50% (removing the top 10 by 30%). They noted 26 rocket bodies had been abandoned since Jan 1, 2024, and cited a 25-year reentry guideline.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;holographic transcranial ultrasound stimulation allows direct control of the stimulated volume&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers from ETH Zurich, the University of Zurich and NYU developed a non‑invasive holographic ultrasound device that stimulated three to five brain regions simultaneously. In mice, hundreds of miniature transducers produced overlapping low‑intensity pulses that formed focal points, lowered activation thresholds by an order of magnitude, and reduced thermal risks versus single‑focus methods. The device had not been tested on humans; researchers planned to study ultrasound interactions with neuronal channel proteins and potential therapies for Alzheimer’s and epilepsy.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“black holes only had three physical characteristics”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article said that black holes were thought to depend only on mass, spin and electric charge (the no-hair hypothesis). Observations of Sgr A* and M87* supported this but showed complications: a hot plasma torus around black holes generated strong magnetic fields traced via radio polarization. Between 2017 and 2021 M87*'s field orientation reversed rapidly. Proposed explanations included shielding by charged regions, turbulent plasma flows, or interactions between black hole and torus rotation.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“If we can use lighter, high-strength material, this would save a considerable amount of energy for the transportation industry.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT engineers developed a 3D-printable aluminum alloy that withstood high temperatures, was described as five times stronger than traditionally manufactured aluminum, and was confirmed to match the strength of the strongest cast aluminum alloys. The team used simulations and machine learning to reduce candidate compositions from over one million to 40, identified an ideal mix, printed it and tested it. They suggested applications including jet-engine fan blades, vacuum pumps, high-end automobiles, and data-center cooling; results were published in Advanced Materials.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Mary E Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries about how the immune system was prevented from attacking the body. The laureates, at the Institute for Systems Biology (Seattle), Sonoma Biotherapeutics (San Francisco) and Osaka University (Japan), shared 11m Swedish kronor. The prize recognised work on T‑cells and peripheral immune tolerance, with Sakaguchi showing mature CD25‑bearing regulatory T‑cells eliminated harmful self‑reactive cells that could cause autoimmune disease.</p>

  <p class="dek">ESA featured eight gravitationally-lensed galaxies imaged by JWST during its Cycle 1 COSMOS-Web surveys. The 255-hour COSMOS-Web program used NIRCam and MIRI to study galaxies from the Epoch of Reionization. The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey inspected over 42,000 galaxies by eye, selected 400 promising candidates, and highlighted eight lenses that spanned foreground ages of 2.7–8.9 billion years after the Big Bang while some background sources dated to under one billion years. One system had been seen by Hubble but was revealed in greater detail by Webb.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““People can hear, understand, and prioritize multiple sounds around them that flow on a moment-to-moment basis.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT McGovern Institute researchers used frequency tagging combined with magnetoencephalography to track how participants followed one of two simultaneous melodies. Musically trained participants performed better; analysis suggested training sharpened neural mechanisms that amplified attended sounds and suppressed distractions. The method oscillated each melody’s volume at distinct frequencies (for example 39 Hz and 43 Hz) to separate brain responses. The study, led by Cassia Low Manting, John Gabrieli, and Daniel Lundqvist, was published in Science Advances on Sept. 17.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The fossil remains of at least 20 hunted horses were found right next to the spears.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">While mining near Schöningen, Germany, excavators in the mid-1990s unearthed spears and well-preserved horse bones. A University of Tübingen-led team reconstructed the genome of Equus mosbachensis from anaerobic, carbonate-rich sediments, producing what authors reported as among the oldest DNA recovered from an open-air site. The horses had been butchered by likely Neanderthals at least ~200,000 years ago; molecular dating gave a mean mitogenome estimate near 360 ka. The work was published in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;For fusion to be a useful energy source it’s going to have to be reliable,&quot; said Allen Wang.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT scientists developed a method to predict tokamak plasma behavior during rampdowns by combining machine-learning tools with a physics-based plasma dynamics model. They trained and tested it on data from an experimental Swiss tokamak and found it quickly learned plasma evolution across different rampdown strategies, achieving high accuracy with relatively little data. The work, reported in an open-access Nature Communications paper, was expected to improve the safety and reliability of future fusion power plants.</p>

  <p class="dek">European researchers used ESO's VLT/UVES to observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS between August and September as it moved from 3.14 AU to 2.14 AU. They found nickel absorption throughout, while iron absorption appeared only inside 2.64 AU, producing an initially very high Ni/Fe ratio that fell dramatically as the comet warmed. The pattern matched sublimation of volatile organometallics (Ni(CO)4 and Fe(CO)5), with nickel production matching Ni(CO)4 rates. 3I/ATLAS was also C2-depleted.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“One of the reasons why we focus on red to near-IR is because those types of dyes penetrate the body and tissue much better than light in the UV and visible range.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT chemists designed a new fluorescent molecule based on a borenium ion that emitted in the red to near-infrared range and could enable clearer tumor imaging. In a Nature Chemistry paper they showed that attaching a ligand stabilized previously too-unstable borenium ions, producing borenium-containing films, powders, and crystals that absorbed and emitted red/near-IR light, which penetrated tissue better than conventional blue/green dyes. Robert Gilliard and lead author Chun-Lin Deng led the work.</p>
