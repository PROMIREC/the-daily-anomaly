  <blockquote class="quote">“Galaxies that are surrounded by lots of other galaxies... tend to grow more slowly and have very different structures compared to their isolated counterparts.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">DEVILS, led by Luke Davies at ICRAR and the University of Western Australia, released its first data after ten years and published a MNRAS paper covering the D10 (COSMOS) region. The release included morphological, redshift, photometric, spectroscopic, group environment and halo catalogues for thousands of galaxies and targeted galaxies up to five billion years ago to compare with present-day systems. The survey mapped small-scale environments and found that galaxies in dense, crowded environments grew more slowly and were more often quenched by processes like ram-pressure stripping and tidal interactions.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MOON, SATURN DAZZLE THANKSGIVING SKIES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“As darkness fell on Thursday, there will be the moon shining in the south-southwest, only several hours away from arriving at its first quarter or &quot;half&quot; phase.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The National weather outlook for Thanksgiving Day predicted generally fair weather across much of the U.S., with exceptions of Great Lakes snow squalls, light snow in parts of Montana and northern Idaho, and rain on Washington and Oregon coasts; the West was unseasonably mild while much of the East was brisk and cold. After a mid‑afternoon turkey dinner, families could step outside to view the first‑quarter moon low south‑southwest with Saturn about 20° to its left and autumn constellations such as the Summer Triangle.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ANCIENT STAR DEFIES AGE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Young, alpha rich stars are quite rare and puzzling.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The red-giant companion to Gaia BH2, a dormant black hole system discovered in 2023, had alpha-element-rich chemistry that implied it was about ten billion years old, but asteroseismology using TESS measured vibrations that showed it was about five billion years old. It rotated once every 398 days—faster than expected—so authors concluded it had been spun up by a stellar merger or by accreting material when the black hole formed. Gaia BH3 lacked expected oscillations, suggesting metal-poor models needed revision.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">CERN FUELS SUPERCONDUCTOR REVOLUTION</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“advances driven by fundamental physics can generate broad societal impact”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">High‑energy physics had long driven superconducting science and CERN had continued to lead developments such as an REBCO high‑temperature superconducting cable. The High‑Luminosity LHC had relied on high‑grade superconductors developed for the field, and future colliders would require new HTS for energy efficiency and sustainability. Next‑generation superconductors had potential for healthcare, mobility, computing, fusion, zero‑emission transport and quantum technologies. The Catalysing Impact event (1–2 Dec 2025, 9:00 am–4:00 pm) brought together researchers, industry, policymakers and investors, offered a webcast and sought to accelerate translation to societal applications.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">NASA FUNDED PLANETS UNITS LAUNCH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““PLANETS is one of the most thoughtfully designed STEM resources I’ve used in an out-of-school setting.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The NASA Science Activation program's PLANETS project, led by Northern Arizona University, launched three free out-of-school-time units for grades 3–5 and 6–8 — Space Hazards, Water in Extreme Environments, and Remote Sensing — each with science and complementary engineering pathways, educator guides, videos, and resources. Subject-matter experts from USGS Astrogeology worked with NAU, the Boston Museum of Science, and WestEd; materials were tested and revised for multilingual, Indigenous, and accessibility needs. All materials were available at planets-stem.org and were supported by NASA award NNX16AC53.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DIURNAL SOLAR TIDES DRIVE VENUS WINDS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“diurnal tides played a primary role”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">New evidence from Lai et al. suggested that a once-daily (diurnal) atmospheric tidal cycle driven by solar heating contributed more to Venus's superrotation than previously thought. The team analyzed 2006–2022 Venus Express and Akatsuki radio-bending data and ran numerical simulations focusing on thermal tides. They found diurnal tides transported momentum toward the cloud tops more than semidiurnal tides; the study included the first southern-hemisphere analysis and called for further clarification.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“confirm the contributions of NASA to Rosalind Franklin”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">At the ESA Ministerial Council in Bremen, ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher announced that NASA had confirmed contributions to the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin rover despite President Trump's proposed budget cutting the collaboration. The 300 kg rover with a 2 m drill had faced delays after NASA withdrew in 2012, partnered with Russia, and then saw ties severed in 2022. ESA funded a new landing platform; NASA pledged a launch vehicle, radioisotope heaters and braking retrorockets for a 2028 launch.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STARLINER DEMOTED: CARGO-ONLY FLIGHT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“carry only cargo”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA ended months of speculation by confirming Boeing’s next Starliner flight would carry only cargo to the International Space Station and was being targeted no earlier than April 2026, contingent on rigorous testing and certification. NASA and Boeing modified their 2014 Commercial Crew contract so Starliner‑1 would fly cargo and then up to three additional missions before the station’s retirement. The decision followed a history of Starliner software and thruster problems on 2019, 2022, and 2024 flights while SpaceX’s Crew Dragon had operated reliably.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ARCHAEOLOGISTS PROVE HUMANS DUG MEGAPITS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“extraordinary structure”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A research team used a novel combination of scientific techniques to analyse the Durrington pit circle near Stonehenge and concluded the roughly 20 yawning pits, over a mile across and centred on Durrington Walls and Woodhenge, had been carved by Neolithic people. Some pits were about 10 m wide and 5 m deep. The 2020 discovery had been hailed as possibly Britain’s largest prehistoric structure and evidence of counting but had faced scepticism. A paper in Internet Archaeology concluded they were man-made.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“plan to cut animal testing through greater use of AI”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Patrick Vallance, the minister for science, research and innovation, unveiled a plan to cut animal testing by increasing use of AI and other technologies, ultimately aiming to phase it out. In a podcast, Madeleine Finlay heard from science editor Ian Sample, Prof Hazel Screen (Queen Mary University London) and Prof Kevin Harrington (Institute of Cancer Research) about how this would affect research and what could replace animal models.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I now have a face like everyone else.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Twenty years after the first face transplant, the procedure's future hung in the balance as patients were dying and outcome data were missing. The world’s first face transplant was performed on Isabelle Dinoire on 27 November 2005 at CHU Amiens‑Picardie after a dog had chewed off parts of her face; surgeons led by Bernard Devauchelle, Sylvie Testelin and Jean‑Michel Dubernard grafted a donor’s nose, lips and chin in a &gt;15‑hour, 50‑person operation. About 50 face transplants had been done, with several notable firsts.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">THANKSGIVING CREW ROCKETS TO ISS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This is my second Thanksgiving in space, so I highly recommend it.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Holiday travel reached new heights on Nov. 27 when NASA astronaut Chris Williams and Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev launched aboard Soyuz MS-28 to the ISS on an eight-month expedition. They lifted off at 4:27 a.m. EST from Baikonur and docked at 6:34 a.m. EST. The Soyuz 2.1a was decorated with pediatric cancer patients' drawings and portraits marking 25 years on the station; zero‑g indicators were a ginger cat toy and a knitted cosmonaut. They joined Expedition 73 members for a Thanksgiving meal.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“AI-accelerated simulations can move beyond pattern recognition.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at RIKEN iTHEMS with the University of Tokyo and Universitat de Barcelona ran the first Milky Way simulation resolving over 100 billion stars across 10,000 years, using 7 million CPU cores, numerical simulations and a machine-learning surrogate. The model was 100× larger and 100× faster than prior efforts; the surrogate, trained on high-resolution supernova simulations, predicted ejecta effects 100,000 years post-explosion, enabling simultaneous galaxy-scale and stellar-scale dynamics. The work was published in SC ’25 proceedings and validated on Fugaku and Miyabi.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ALGORITHMIC PERSONALIZATION SKEWS LEARNING</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““learners in personalized environments sample feature information more selectively during the learning phase””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers from Vanderbilt University and The Ohio State University reported in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General that algorithmic personalization narrowed encountered information, biased how people explored features, distorted category representations, and produced inflated confidence in incorrect judgments. In a controlled experiment using fictional “alien” creatures defined by six visual features, some participants saw balanced examples while others received a YouTube-like personalized sequence; personalization alone changed sampling, learning and confidence despite absence of politics or emotion.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;was to examine the feasibility of controlling the behavior of a dog&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Declassified documents revealed that the CIA’s MKUltra (1950s–60s) ran 149 subprojects testing mind-control on humans and animals. In Subproject 94 (1961–62) researchers implanted electrodes in six dogs to remotely control their movement; experiments were largely successful but suffered infections and logistical issues and were cancelled before operational use. MKUltra also involved bats, painted foxes, trained hawks and ravens, an LSD-injected elephant, and the ill-fated 'Acoustic Kitty'—and considered using larger animals or humans.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“expanded the orbiting laboratory's crew to 10 for the next two weeks.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA astronaut Chris Williams, with Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikaev, arrived at the International Space Station, expanding its crew to 10 for two weeks. They launched aboard Soyuz MS-28 from Baikonur at 4:27 a.m. EST and docked at Rassvet module three hours later. Hatch opening was expected about 10:10 a.m.; they were to be welcomed by Expedition 73 crewmembers. Williams was to conduct research and technology demonstrations, including a modular workout system, cryogenic fuel-efficiency and semiconductor crystal experiments, and re-entry safety work. Expedition 74 was set to begin Dec. 8.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">GAMMA HALO POINTS TO DARK MATTER</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“it would mark the first time humanity has 'seen' dark matter”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Professor Tomonori Totani analyzed Fermi telescope data and reported a halo of 20 GeV gamma rays extending toward the galactic center whose shape, energy spectrum, and collision rate matched predictions for WIMP annihilation. He argued common astrophysical sources could not easily explain the signal. If confirmed, the result would have required revising the Standard Model to include a new particle. Independent verification—such as finding the same signature in Milky Way dwarf galaxies—was required, while underground detectors continued searching.</p>
