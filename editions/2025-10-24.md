  <h3 class="hed">EUROPEAN SPACE GIANT TO CHALLENGE SPACEX</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This proposed new company marks a pivotal milestone for Europe’s space industry.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Airbus, Leonardo and Thales finalized a deal to combine their space divisions into a France-based, standalone company employing about 25,000 people, with Airbus owning 35% and the others 32.5% each. It aimed to increase European 'sovereignty' in space, bolster defense and rival SpaceX (including Starlink), with an initial focus on making satellite development and manufacturing more efficient. No site closures were planned, regulators still had to approve the merger, and the entity was expected to be operational by 2027.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MASSIVE COSMIC MAP PROBES DARK SECRETS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Our results find that the Lambda-CDM model describes the observable universe well.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A new catalog of tens of thousands of massive galaxy clusters was assembled from six years of Dark Energy Survey data using the Dark Energy Camera on the 4-meter Blanco Telescope in Chile, producing a 3D map across billions of light-years. The team used optical and near-infrared data to estimate distances, modeled cluster overlap and masses, and tested Lambda‑CDM versus the S8 tension; they reported consistency with Lambda‑CDM. The results were published Sept. 18 in Physical Review D.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ELECTRONS SPY ON NUCLEAR SECRETS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Our results lay the groundwork for subsequent studies aiming to measure violations of fundamental symmetries at the nuclear level.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Physicists at MIT developed a molecule-based, table-top method to probe an atom’s nucleus by using its own electrons as “messengers” inside radium monofluoride. In a Science paper they measured slight energy shifts of electrons that briefly penetrated the radium nucleus within the molecule, using those shifts to infer the nucleus’ internal structure and its &quot;magnetic distribution.&quot; They planned to map the radium nucleus to inform searches for symmetry violations tied to the matter–antimatter asymmetry; experiments were done with CRIS at CERN.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DINOSAURS THRIVED UNTIL IMPACT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“dinosaurs were thriving in New Mexico until the end of the Cretaceous.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The study used new argon dating and magnetic reversal alignment to show Naashoibito Member fossils dated to the last few hundred thousand years before the K–Pg impact. The Alamo Wash fauna differed from Hell Creek, indicating two late Cretaceous dinosaur bioprovinces (north and south), likely driven by temperature; mammals did not show the same split. Researchers concluded dinosaurs were thriving in New Mexico until the end of the Cretaceous, arguing against reduced diversity as a widespread pre-impact condition.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We are looking for the best fin shape to maximise heat transfer.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA described a European Condensation on Fins experiment aboard the ISS that examined how liquid films formed on a one-centimetre-tall aluminum-alloy fin under microgravity. It tested heat transfer and capillary pressure during film condensation using a low-surface-tension refrigerant that wetted and pooled at the fin base, removed by a sponge-like material and pump. Microgravity removed gravity drainage and vapour convection, enabling clearer observation. Results were intended to refine models and inform cooling and coating technologies on Earth and in space.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“find more brain-inspired, energy-efficient ways of doing AI.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Miranda Schwacke, an MIT graduate student in DMSE and member of Kitchen Matters, used kitchen experiments to illustrate materials concepts, notably testing butter to produce denser gingerbread for a structurally sound house. She researched neuromorphic computing to address AI’s high energy cost, developed electrochemical ionic synapses whose conductivity could be tuned like neural connections, and said the brain’s low energy use inspired efforts toward more energy-efficient AI; advisor Bilge Yildiz noted reduced data movement aided that efficiency.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ESA STAGES CATACLYSMIC SOLAR DRILL</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“There is no good outcome for a satellite in the event it is in the direct path of a solar storm.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA required operational crews of new satellites to simulate massive solar storms and ran a three-stage exercise with the Sentinel 1‑D team, whose launch was scheduled for November 5. The simulation began with an X45‑class flare that knocked out GPS, was followed by high‑energy particles that flipped electronic bits, and, 15–18 hours later, a coronal mass ejection that swelled Earth’s atmosphere up to 400%, increasing drag and collision risk. Teams practiced damage‑control maneuvers and fuel tradeoffs.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“having a normal niche may not be essential for stem cells to work.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers described Schmidtea mediterranea, a Mediterranean planarian that could regrow heads and bodies, whose pluripotent stem cells made up about 15% of its body. A Cell Reports study led by Frederick Mann with co-authors including Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado used transcriptomics to analyze stem-cell niches, identified nearby finger-like “hecatonoblasts” that did not control stem-cell fate, and found stronger signals came from distant intestinal cells, suggesting a global communication system that could inform human regenerative therapies.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Welcome to ESA!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Cyprus signed an Associate Agreement with the European Space Agency and was expected to become an Associate Member after ratification, targeting early 2026 during its EU Presidency. The signing, by ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher and Deputy Minister Nicodemos Damianou, was witnessed by ESA delegations. After a decade of cooperation (European Cooperating State since 2017), Cyprus, with space law, a national strategy, industry links and a focus on telecommunications, Earth observation and navigation, planned to confirm optional programme subscriptions at the 26–27 November Ministerial Council in Bremen.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FIRST AUSTRALIANS WERE FOSSIL HUNTERS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;the retrieval of the fossils&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Archaeologists reexamined a short-faced kangaroo tibia from Mammoth Cave and concluded that shallow angled cut marks—first noticed in 1970 and dated to 44,500–55,200 years ago—were likely made by First Peoples retrieving fossils, not butchering. The paper by Michael Archer and colleagues reopened debate about whether humans caused Australia’s Ice Age megafauna extinctions. People had arrived around 65,000 years ago and coexisted with giant marsupials (including short-faced kangaroos, Zygomaturus, Diprotodon) until their disappearance ~45,000–40,000 years ago.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Apex is built to move fast.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Defense contractors pitched capabilities for the Trump administration’s proposed Golden Dome missile shield, which centered on thousands of space-based interceptors. The Pentagon sought prototype proposals for SBIs and expected companies to self-fund demonstrations. Apex, a Los Angeles startup that had raised over $500 million, launched its first satellite in 2024 and won a $46 million Space Force contract, and it said it would in under a year launch an &quot;Orbital Magazine&quot; host platform to deploy prototype missile interceptors.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“W was the last of the 20 canonical amino acids to be added to the genetic code.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Arizona led by Joanna Masel and Sawsan Wehbi argued that the accepted order in which the 20 canonical amino acids emerged was biased by assumptions about biotic versus abiotic sources. They used software and NCBI data to build evolutionary trees of protein domains dating to LUCA and proposed rethinking that order. They reported tryptophan (W) was more common pre‑LUCA (1.2%) than post‑LUCA (0.9%) and suggested ancient codes and noncanonical amino acids may have existed.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“only a handful of bright meteors aligned gracefully near the constellation Orion”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Orionid meteor shower peaked Oct. 21–23, and debris from Halley’s Comet produced shooting stars visible under a new-moon dark sky. Photographer Osama Fathi captured a composite over Lake Qarun on Oct. 19 by combining a three-minute sky exposure with multiple 10-second meteor frames taken with a Nikon Z6 and 14–24 mm lens; only a few bright meteors aligned near Orion. Robert Lunsford said rates remained above 10 per hour Oct. 24–26 as the radiant shifted into western Gemini.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a pivotal milestone for Europe’s space industry”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Airbus, Leonardo and Thales struck a deal to combine their space businesses into a single European technology company intended to rival SpaceX, and it was expected to generate about €6.5bn (£5.6bn) in annual revenue. Airbus was to hold 35% and Leonardo and Thales 32.5% each. The Toulouse-based group was to employ about 25,000, become operational in 2027 after regulatory approval, and deliver mid‑triple‑digit millions of euros in annual operating-income synergies after five years; unions were to be consulted and no immediate job cuts were planned.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Marine phosphorus and atmospheric oxygen were coupled during the Great Oxidation Event”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Earth's early atmosphere lacked free oxygen and was nitrogen-dominated with far more CO2 and methane from methanogens. About 2.4 billion years ago the Great Oxygenation Event began when cyanobacteria produced oxygen by photosynthesis, enabling more energy-rich respiration and complex life. New research (Dodd et al., Nature Communications) showed marine phosphorus availability had surged periodically, triggering photosynthetic microbe blooms that drove increases in atmospheric oxygen.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“In space, you get almost unlimited, low-cost renewable energy.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An NVIDIA H100 GPU, about 100 times more powerful than any processor that had flown in space, was scheduled to fly aboard the Starcloud-1 satellite on a SpaceX Falcon 9 next month. Starcloud said the mission tested orbital data processing as a step toward building large-scale space data centers to reduce environmental burdens. The firm predicted cost reductions with SpaceX’s Starship and said Starcloud-1 would process Earth‑observing data to deliver rapid insights.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I say bring it on.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">At the IUCN’s 2025 World Conservation Congress, conservationists debated genetically modifying wildlife and considered a proposed moratorium after more than 90 NGOs urged a ban. The author argued humans had long altered other species via domestication and selective breeding and that contemporary human-driven environmental change was already accelerating evolution. New tools like Crispr could engineer disease-resistant seabirds, pollution-tolerant fish and heat-resistant coral; the author treated lab editing as an extension of historical practices.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“'new era' in tackling blindness”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Guardian Science podcast reported that an electronic eye implant, half the thickness of a human hair, had helped people with previously incurable sight loss to see again. Madeleine Finlay interviewed Moorfields surgeon Mahi Muqit about what the implant had meant for his patients and the possible future of vision-loss therapies. The piece suggested the device opened a potential 'new era' in tackling blindness and included clips from the BBC.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““They’re behind schedule, and so the president wants to make sure we beat the Chinese.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy said SpaceX had fallen behind developing Starship as a human lunar lander and that NASA’s 2027 crewed moon-landing target was no longer achievable. He said he intended to reopen the lander competition, potentially involving Blue Origin’s Mk1 multi-lander plan and other contractors. The article noted SpaceX’s $2.9 billion 2021 contract, Blue Origin’s $3.4 billion award, technical in-space refueling challenges, and that Lockheed Martin said it stood ready to offer an Apollo-like lander within 30 months.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;It's very hard to actually prove, but it does seem likely,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">New simulations led by Moorits Muru suggested the faint gamma-ray glow at the Milky Way’s center could be a dark-matter signature. The team found central dark matter need not be spherical but flattened, egg-shaped, matching the Fermi telescope’s broad, bright 7,000-light-year glow first seen in 2008. The glow had been attributed to WIMP annihilation or millisecond pulsars; the simulations, which included billions of years of mergers, showed violent events left fingerprints shaping the dark-matter distribution.</p>

Dr Andrew Flynn and colleagues concluded this timing cast doubt on a pre-impact continental decline, suggesting Late Cretaceous North American dinosaurs were diverse and remained extant until the asteroid strike.</p>

Developed for over a decade, the tailless flying‑wing reportedly performed surveillance and air‑to‑surface strikes, reached about 690 mph, carried precision bombs, and featured claimed autonomy for takeoff, landing and mission execution. Analysts were skeptical, and the U.S. favored Collaborative Combat Aircraft human‑machine teams instead.</p>
