  <h3 class="hed">ASTROPHOTOGRAPHER UNVEILS ELEPHANT TRUNK</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The image highlights various celestial elements, including a notable emission nebula, by contrast against the bluish cavity that fills the center of IC 1396,”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astrophotographer Terry Hancock captured a dramatic view of IC 1396, the Elephant's Trunk Nebula, about 2,400 light-years away in Cepheus. The image showed an emission nebula ionized by young stars, dark filaments of star-forming material, and the roughly 20‑light‑year‑long trunk near the center. The complex spanned just over 5° of sky. Hancock recorded nearly 114 hours with a 180 mm Newtonian and a bespoke camera on Sept. 22, 2021, using filters and processing in Pixinsight and Photoshop.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“their gravitational field cannot be determined by their visible matter alone.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An international team led by the Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam analyzed stellar velocities in 12 of the smallest, faintest dwarf galaxies and found their internal gravitational fields could not be explained by visible matter alone. MOND predictions failed to reproduce observed accelerations, while simulations assuming dark matter haloes (EDGE simulations on the DiRAC facility) matched the data better; the results were published in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“confirm that our organism grows in the space environment as it does on the ground”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The European Space Agency launched project HOBI-WAN to test production of Solein, a powdered microbial protein from Solar Foods made from air, electricity and microbes. On Earth Solein used ammonia for nitrogen, but in space ESA planned to use urea derived from urine. Solar Foods worked with OHB System AG for eight months of ground development before an intended test aboard the ISS. The project aimed to validate gas fermentation and microbial growth under microgravity, where gas and liquid behavior differed.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">WEATHER, SHUTDOWN STALL MARS LAUNCH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Today's NG-2 launch is scrubbed due to weather, specifically the cumulus cloud rule.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin scrubbed the Nov. 9 New Glenn launch of NASA's twin ESCAPADE Mars probes after foul weather and a cumulus-cloud violation kept the mission grounded during an 88-minute window. Because the FAA had announced an indefinite daytime-launch halt amid a government shutdown, Blue Origin worked with the FAA and the range to seek an exemption; it scheduled the next launch attempt for Nov. 12 with a 2:50–4:17 PM EST window.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The tiny worlds here, invisible to our unassisted eyes, are if anything more intricate, complex and extraordinary than anything so far seen in deep space.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article previewed Nanocosmos: Journeys in Electron Space (Abrams, 2025), a 320-page electron-microscope coffee-table book by Michael Benson that compiled hundreds of SEM scans captured over six years at the Canadian Museum of Nature. It shared two exclusive images of lunar impact glass from Apollo 16 samples and explained such glass formed when meteoroid impacts melted and rapidly cooled lunar soil. Benson's background in film, visual effects and his 2018 book Space Odyssey were noted.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ORBITAL WIZARDRY SAVES MARS MISSION</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;ESCAPADE is pursuing a very unusual trajectory&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astrodynamics solutions allowed NASA to save its ESCAPADE Mars mission after Blue Origin's New Glenn wasn’t ready for ESCAPADE’s original 2024 launch window. Instead of a direct Hohmann transfer, mission designers put two identical, low-cost probes into an Earth loiter orbit to wait until Earth and Mars were aligned in November of next year. NASA paid about $20 million for the launch of the under-$80 million mission and accepted extra risk because New Glenn was on its second, un‑certified flight.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">METEORITES SPARK MARTIAN DUST AVALANCHES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Dust, wind, and sand dynamics appear to be the main seasonal drivers of slope streak formation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Recurring slope lineae (RSL) were imaged by ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (CaSSIS) on Apollinaris Mons on Christmas 2023 and were linked to a dust avalanche and clustered impact craters. Valentin Tertius Bickel analyzed over two million MRO streaks (2006–2024) with machine learning, produced a streak census showing five hotspots, and attributed about 0.1% of annual streaks to meteoroid impacts and marsquakes, concluding that dust, wind and sand were the main drivers.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">EUCLID COULD REVEAL BILLIONS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Because getting a second data point would allow us to see what moved in those six years”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Euclid had about eight extra years of fuel beyond its six-year primary mission. Luigi “Rolly” Bedin proposed repeating Euclid’s original observations to provide a second epoch for measuring proper motions, and adding a third epoch about six months apart to estimate parallaxes for a limited set of stars. Euclid could detect objects five to six orders of magnitude fainter than Gaia, potentially finding billions of extra sources and improving overlap accuracy by about tenfold; parallax observations posed engineering challenges but were judged feasible.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">INVESTOR HYPE HOBBLES BRAIN CURES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;dumb transhumanist ideas&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Experts said investors’ fascination with brain uploading and merging with AI—from figures such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman—had distorted the neurotechnology debate and hindered efforts to cure disease. They noted recent successes (an implant that decoded inner speech; an eye that restored sight) and widespread tech investment (Neuralink, Merge Labs, Apple, Meta, Google), said neurotech had near-term therapeutic potential, but that brain‑uploading remained distant or probably impossible.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SECOND NEW GLENN FLIGHT SCRUBBED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“a lazy, 12-month kidney bean-shaped orbit”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin postponed New Glenn's second flight, scheduled for 2:45 PM ET from Cape Canaveral, after multiple weather holds and canceled the attempt around 4:13 PM; the next opportunity was unclear. The FAA had issued an emergency order limiting commercial launches to 10:00 PM–6:00 AM during a government shutdown. The rocket, whose development had been delayed and which had flown its maiden mission earlier that year, carried two Rocket Lab-built UC Berkeley satellites for NASA's Escapade mission, destined to reach Mars in 2027.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I couldn’t believe it.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Robert Beattie, an 82-year-old retired Australian science and agriculture teacher, discovered specimens of a 151-million-year-old midge that challenged understandings of insect evolution and amounted to a new species. His interest began after finding a Permian shell in 1948; he later studied palaeontology at Macquarie University, collected fossils for the Australian Museum, and presented Talbragar finds in 2016. Dr Viktor Baranov identified the undescribed insects as midges and visited the Australian Museum in early 2020 to examine them.</p>
