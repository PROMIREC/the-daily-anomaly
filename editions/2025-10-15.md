  <blockquote class="quote">“India is losing sunlight.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A study by six Indian scientists analyzed data from 20 weather stations (1988–2018) and found that sunshine hours had steadily declined across most of India, driven by clouds, aerosols and local weather. The steepest annual declines occurred in northern inland sites (Amritsar, Kolkata), the Himalayan belt and the west coast (Mumbai). All nine regions showed annual declines; seasonally, October–May rose while June–July dropped. Researchers linked losses to 1990s-era urbanisation, fossil-fuel and biomass-burning aerosols, winter smog and monsoon cloud cover.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This next iteration will be used for the first Starship orbital flights, operational payload missions, propellant transfer and more.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched Starship Flight 11, sending the 403-foot vehicle on a suborbital test that successfully returned both Super Heavy booster and Ship to splashdowns; Ship relit an engine and deployed eight dummy payloads. The launch closed the Version 2 era and SpaceX said multiple Version 3 vehicles were in build. V3 was to be about 1.5 m taller, used revamped propulsion for Raptor 3 (33 Raptors on Super Heavy, six on Ship) and added energy-storage and avionics upgrades for longer missions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“extraordinary orchid that lives its entire life underground”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Rhizanthella was an underground orchid that flowered below ground, had no leaves and fed via a fungus that drew nutrients from soil and via roots of Melaleuca uncinata. Discovered in Western Australia in 1928, it remained hard to find; reddish blooms in creamy‑pink bracts smelled of vanilla and were possibly pollinated by termites or tiny flies. Five species were among the rarest orchids, vulnerable to habitat loss and drought, and Kingsley Dixon attempted conservation by co‑culturing fungus with seed and planting them with potted Melaleuca.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;multiple billions of dollars.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">OpenAI signed a deal with Broadcom to design custom AI accelerators and systems; Broadcom planned to deploy racks starting in the second half of next year and finish by end of 2029. The 10-gigawatt agreement was worth &quot;multiple billions of dollars.&quot; The deal followed NVIDIA's (a $100 billion investment and 10 GW) and AMD's (6 GW, tens of billions, possible 10% stake) agreements; OpenAI also secured 4.5 GW from Oracle. CEO Sam Altman targeted 250 GW over eight years; revenue was expected at $13 billion.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“standardized mechanical connection”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at Germany’s DLR proposed a modular rover architecture in which a single rover pulled standardized payloads that shared mechanical, electrical and fluid connections. Payloads were designed for power, science, or construction and could be transported or linked into infrastructure; a lunar water-extraction use case was described. Simulations of TRP-derived hybrid legged rovers (1,500 runs) varied wheel control, leg layout, payload and terrain, and found trade-offs that affected hip torque, ground clearance and power consumption.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“disconnection event”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astrophotographer Brennan Gilmore captured images and a 60-minute timelapse that showed the solar wind stripping a large section of comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)'s tail during a disconnection event on Oct. 2, and a glowing green coma passing near TW Leonis Minoris on Oct. 4. The work, taken with a Takahashi Epsilon 130D and a ZWO camera from Cismont, Virginia, noted the comet had brightened since its Jan. 3 discovery and was about magnitude +5.1 ahead of an Oct. 21 Earth approach and Nov. 8 perihelion in its 1,350-year orbit.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It is mandatory to reshape our conception of fertilizers”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Giorgio Rizzo, born in Palermo and trained in organic chemistry, worked as a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in Benedetto Marelli’s lab. He studied plant responses to heat, drought and prolonged UV, developed sustainable seed‑coating fertilizers, and explored rare‑earth elements to boost plant resilience. He aimed to reduce the environmental and energy impacts of NPK fertilizers by using abundant chitin and chitosan to lower costs, and he received a Kavanaugh Fellowship to help commercialize the work.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“wingman to crewed helicopters”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">At AUSA 2025 on October 13, Boeing unveiled the Collaborative Transformational Rotorcraft (CxR), a large unmanned tiltrotor intended as a &quot;wingman&quot; for crewed helicopters. Boeing pitched a modular, expeditionary VTOL weighing 5,000–7,000 lb with a single turboshaft, two tilting propellers, 200–250 kt speed, and 1,000–2,000 lb payload. It was offered as a family of systems with a combat CCR variant carrying weapons, sensors, EW, and launched-effects drones.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“mimic the trajectory that future missions returning to Starbase will fly.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX's second-generation Starship achieved every major objective on its 11th flight test, launched from Starbase, Texas on October 13 as the second-gen vehicle's final flight. All 33 Raptor engines ignited, stage separation and first-stage ascent went smoothly, the Super Heavy booster splashed down, and Starship deployed all Starlink simulators before reentry. During reentry it was intentionally stressed to test the heatshield and executed a banking maneuver. SpaceX said it would now focus on developing next-generation Starship and Super Heavy for orbital and payload missions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““People studying quantum materials are very focused on their properties and quantum mechanics,” says Mingda Li.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed a framework to evaluate quantum materials' scale-up potential by combining a material’s quantum behavior with cost, supply-chain resilience, environmental footprint, and other factors. They applied it to over 16,000 materials, finding those with the largest quantum fluctuation in the centers of their electrons tended to be costlier and more environmentally damaging, and identified materials that balanced quantum functionality with sustainability to guide development of commercially viable applications.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers at Auburn University used NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to detect ultraviolet hydroxyl (OH) emissions from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, indicating surface water, in a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. OH was detected when ATLAS was beyond three times Earth’s distance from the Sun, leaking roughly 40 kg/s—comparable to a hydrant at full power—suggesting atypical structure such as detaching icy fragments that vaporized and fed a gaseous cloud.</p>

  <p class="dek">SpaceX’s Starship, described as the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built, successfully travelled halfway around the world and released mock satellites during its 11th test flight on Monday. The report said a previous test flight in August had also been successful — following a string of explosive failures — and had followed a similar path with similar goals.</p>

  <p class="dek">Impulse Space, founded by ex‑SpaceX engineer Tom Mueller, unveiled a roadmap to deliver 0.5–13‑ton payloads to the Moon by as early as 2028. The plan paired a Helios kick stage (first flight slated for late next year) with a piggybacked lunar lander: launch to LEO on a medium/heavy rocket, a weeklong Helios cruise to low lunar orbit, then lander separation and descent. Mira had demonstrated in‑space mobility in 2023 and 2025; the lander engine used nitrous/ethane.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“prolonged activation of excitatory lPBN neurons can drive a chronic pain-like state”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">After mouse experiments, biologist Nicholas Betley identified a population of Y1R neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus that were active in chronic pain. Activating those neurons produced persistent pain behaviors, while blocking them shortened pain responses. A Y1R subpopulation remained active during prolonged pain. Survival threats increased neuropeptide Y production and reduced pain. The findings suggested drugs that boosted NPY might offer an alternative to opioids.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FOUR CMES COULD IGNITE AURORAS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We could be dealing with their effects until early October 17, assuming the sun does not send us any other Earth-directed storms!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A train of four coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from sunspot region AR4246, launched Oct. 11–13, was forecast to reach Earth Oct. 15–17. The strongest disturbances were expected late Oct. 15–16 and could have reached G1 (minor) geomagnetic levels, producing auroras at high and some mid-latitudes and causing weak power-grid fluctuations and minor satellite impacts. NOAA and the U.K. Met Office expected most activity near Oct. 16. The first CME was likely mild; the following three were described as pancaked together.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Starship’s eleventh flight test reached every objective”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX closed a troubled chapter with a near-perfect Starship test flight. The 404-foot vehicle’s 33 Raptor engines produced 16.7 million pounds of thrust and executed its flight plan; the reused Super Heavy booster validated a staged landing-burn sequence but lost one engine during descent with no impact. It was the fifth and final Version 2 flight and the 11th full-scale test; earlier V2 launches had failed, and an August test exposed heat-shield issues while a 'crunch wrap' experiment showed promise.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“allowing elemental abundances to vary with time produced models that finally match real solar observations”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article explained that coronal rain—cool, dense plasma falling from the Sun's corona—formed far faster during flares than traditional models predicted. Models had assumed fixed elemental abundances, which required hours or days of heating, conflicting with minute-scale flares. Graduate student Luke Benavitz and astronomer Jeffrey Reep showed that allowing abundances (e.g., iron) to vary with time produced models that matched observed cooling and rain, implying cooling times and coronal heating assumptions needed revision and could affect space‑weather forecasts.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The weak force can do things that no other force can.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Physicists in the 1930s observed beta decay and Enrico Fermi proposed a new force that transformed protons and neutrons while emitting an electron and a neutrino. The weak nuclear force changed quark flavors, enabled neutron–proton swaps, had a coupling about 100,000 times smaller than electromagnetism, and an extremely short range (~10^−18–10^−17 m). Its massive carriers, the W and Z bosons, were later explained by the Higgs mechanism, which gave them and other particles mass.</p>

  <p class="dek">An international team led by Dr Isobel Romero-Shaw used simulations to examine formation scenarios for the eccentric binary black hole event GW200208_222617, which multiple groups had identified during LIGO–Virgo's third run. They found the eccentric orbit most likely arose from three-body interactions or dynamical encounters in dense clusters, ruling out simple isolated binary evolution. The study recommended improved waveform models and anticipated more eccentric detections as sensitivities rose.</p>

  <p class="dek">MIT researchers published in Science analyzed seismic records from the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes, removed sequence-generated waves, and used other seismic signals, ambient noise, and receiver-function analyses to map wave-speed changes. They found the shallow crust (about above 10 km) healed within months after the quake, while the mid-crust showed slower or persistent change that accumulated during the post‑seismic phase rather than at the time of the earthquake. Authors included Jared Bryan, William Frank, and Pascal Audet.</p>
