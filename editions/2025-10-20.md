  <blockquote class="quote">“trying to spread fear”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An increasing number of drones were spotted around Danish airports (Aalborg, Billund, Copenhagen), preventing scheduled flights from landing or taking off and mirroring disruption at London Gatwick in 2023. Sightings occurred near military airbases hosting F-16s and F-35s. Civilian drone flights were banned for a week before an EU summit on Oct 1. Authorities debated how to suppress or destroy drones; Danish officials said the flights aimed to spread fear, and some blamed alleged Russian hybrid operations, which the Kremlin denied. Ukrainian forces used nets against drones.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we may eventually discover the Inflationary rhythm of the night.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Article described that cosmic Inflation was theorized to have produced a background of long-wavelength gravitational waves, too faint for LIGO, so astronomers used pulsar timing arrays (e.g., NANOGrav) as precision clocks to seek them. It noted that supermassive black hole binaries could mimic that background, and Yamamoto &amp; Asada argued that interference &quot;beats&quot; from multiple binaries could identify and be filtered to reveal an inflationary signal. It reported NANOGrav data was not yet conclusive.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“To see this level of benefit for patients who have endured numerous treatments is incredibly encouraging.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A triple-action drug, amivantamab, was given subcutaneously in the Orig-AMI 4 trial (funded by Janssen) to 86 patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from 11 countries, including the UK. Presented at the ESMO conference in Berlin, early results showed 76% of treated patients experienced tumour shrinkage or disease control after prior immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Clinicians described the injectable agent, which blocked two cancer pathways and aided the immune response, as an encouraging, potentially more convenient treatment option.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a colossal star-forming region”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astrophotographer Ronald Brecher captured a colorful portrait of the Heart Nebula (IC 1805), located about 6,000 light-years away in the Perseus arm. The colossal star-forming region, named for its cartoonish heart shape, hosted energetic young stars sculpting dust pillars and lay roughly 5° from the star Segin in Cassiopeia; the Fishhead Nebula hung below. Brecher imaged the scene from Guelph, Canada with a Sky-Watcher Esprit 70 EDX refractor and astronomy camera, compiling over 40 hours of filtered exposures that were color-mapped in post-processing.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Why aren’t more animals hermaphrodites?”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Guardian ran a readers' question in its long-running series asking why more animals were not hermaphrodites, noting that snails and worms had succeeded with mutual gene-sharing while vertebrates had evolved away from hermaphroditism. Readers were invited to post answers in the comments or email nq@theguardian.com; a selection was to be published the following Sunday.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we suggest that this region is a cryovolcano with a caldera structure”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers published in The Planetary Science Journal analyzed New Horizons imagery, digital elevation models and analog sites to assess cryovolcanic activity at the Kildaze caldera in Hayabusa Terra. They compared Kildaze to other Plutonian sites and terrestrial/Martian calderas, inferred the water ice there was a few million years old (much younger than Pluto), and proposed Kildaze was a cryovolcano with a caldera that emitted about 1,000 km3 of cryolava. The study discussed tidal and radiogenic heating and ongoing analysis of New Horizons data.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Barrelling into the atmosphere at about 66 km/s, they create swift, bright streaks.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The piece reported the Orionids were a fast meteor shower, hitting at about 66 km/s and creating swift, bright streaks that lingered briefly. It said the shower typically produced about 20 meteors per hour and had originated in Halley’s comet’s tail. Observing prospects were favourable: a waning crescent moon (~30% lit) rose early, allowing unhindered viewing before ~03:00 BST; Orion rose before midnight and was higher from southern latitudes. A chart showed east from London at 00:30 BST on 22 October.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“One day, I want to win the Nobel Prize.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Chen Ning Yang died aged 103, Chinese state media reported; CCTV's obituary cited illness. He and Lee Tsung-Dao won the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for work on parity laws that led to discoveries about elementary particles. Yang had been a professor and honorary dean at Tsinghua's Institute for Advanced Study. Born in 1922 in Anhui and raised on Tsinghua's campus, he earned a 1942 science degree at National Southwest Associated University, a master's at Tsinghua, and studied under Enrico Fermi at University of Chicago.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It’s the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in…”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NVIDIA revealed the first Blackwell wafer manufactured in the US, assembled at TSMC’s Phoenix, Arizona fab. It had unveiled the Blackwell platform last year; Amazon, Google and OpenAI had committed to adopt it, and NVIDIA said it was more powerful and used 25× less cost and energy than its predecessor. US wafer production helped insulate NVIDIA from tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Jensen Huang spoke at the event; Blackwell was ready for volume production, and NVIDIA planned further US manufacturing and half‑a‑trillion‑dollar infrastructure investments with partners.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Cascade Advanced Energy Facility”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Amazon revealed plans for a modular reactor (SMR) in Richland, Washington, to meet its AI and cloud energy demand. It partnered with Energy Northwest and X-energy to build Cascade Advanced Energy Facility. The SMR had a smaller footprint than traditional reactors and could produce up to 960 megawatts. Amazon planned four SMRs in the first phase (320 MW) with an option to expand to 12 units; construction was to start before the decade's end and operations in 2030s. Other tech firms pursued similar nuclear plans.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Today’s ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">US District Judge Phyllis Hamilton reduced damages awarded to Meta against NSO Group from $167 million to $4 million but issued a permanent injunction barring NSO from targeting WhatsApp. Meta had sued in 2019 over Pegasus spyware, which it alleged spied on 1,400 people in 20 countries and could infect devices via WhatsApp messages or missed calls. Hamilton cited defendants’ admissions about ongoing collection of WhatsApp messages and ordered deletion of Meta-related code; damages were reduced to fit legal proportionality.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we are ready to amaze every astronomy lover with our live feed!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Two comets, C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) and C/2025 R2 (SWAN), were about to make their closest approaches to Earth and the Virtual Telescope Project hosted a livestream on Oct. 20. Lemmon passed about 56 million miles (90 million km) from Earth and SWAN about 24 million miles (39 million km); both peaked in brightness around Oct. 20–21. Lemmon (discovered January 2025) was visible after sunset with binoculars or small telescopes; SWAN (discovered September 2025 by SOHO’s SWAN) was best seen low in the predawn east.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MARS' CRATERS REVEAL ICE AGES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Mars went through repeated ice ages, but the amount of ice deposited in craters steadily shrank over time.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Japanese-led researchers, led by Trishit Ruj, analyzed CTX and HiRISE images of glaciated craters between 20°N and 45°N and found layered ice deposits that recorded repeated ice ages during the Amazonian (ca. 640 to 98 million years ago). The ice consistently clustered on shadowed southwestern crater walls across multiple glacial periods but diminished steadily, indicating Mars lost water over eons. They attributed cycles to obliquity-driven shifts and suggested the deposits could guide future in-situ water resources. The study appeared in Geology.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“record-breaking 31st mission for this Falcon 9's first stage”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Oct. 19, a Falcon 9 launched 28 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral at 1:39 p.m. EDT and its first-stage booster 1067 set a reuse record with its 31st flight. Booster 1067 returned about 8.5 minutes after liftoff and landed on the drone ship A Shortfall of Gravitas; the upper stage deployed the satellites about 64 minutes after launch. The story was updated with launch, landing and deployment details and corrected a prior claim about the 10,000th Starlink.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">GROUND RULES CRUSH SPACE SOLAR</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“there could be 3,600 SBSP satellites in operation in GEO.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An Italian–German team calculated maximum deliverable power from GEO space‑based solar power (SBSP) by estimating how many satellites could operate and how much each could feed into grids. They used four scenarios constrained mainly by a 0.1° Minimum Distance Angle (MDA, 147 km aperture). Scenario totals were 3,600; 2,509 (accounting for existing GEO slots); 1,771 (rectennas limited to land within ±30°); and 364 when rectennas were limited to areas ≥3,000 people/km². Power per satellite used area, efficiency, incidence angle and relatively constant GEO irradiance.</p>
