  <blockquote class="quote">“This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An international team used ESO's VLT and JWST instruments to observe Cha 1107-7626, a rogue planet about 620 light-years away in Chamaeleon. They found it was 5–10 times Jupiter's mass, surrounded by an accretion disk and still growing. Between April and August accretion intensified eightfold to about six billion tonnes per second—the strongest recorded for a planetary-mass object. Spectra showed increased water vapor and signs that magnetic activity drove the burst, implying star-like formation pathways for some free-floating planets.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Glaciers are melting everywhere in the world.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Matthias Huss recalled that when he first visited Rhône Glacier 35 years ago the ice had been a short walk from his parents' car and had felt 'eternal', but by now it lay a half-hour walk away. The article reported that in 2024 glaciers outside Greenland and Antarctica lost 450 billion tonnes of ice — equal to a 7km cube and 180 million Olympic pools — and that Switzerland's glaciers lost a quarter of their ice in the last decade, experts tied to global warming.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“In just a couple of minutes, the model predicted that enterololin binds to a protein complex called LolCDE.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at MIT CSAIL and McMaster identified enterololin, a compound that suppressed E. coli linked to Crohn’s-like flares while largely sparing the rest of the gut microbiome in mice and improving recovery versus vancomycin. They used the generative AI DiffDock to predict that enterololin bound the LolCDE lipoprotein-transport complex in minutes, then validated that mechanism with evolved resistant mutants, RNA sequencing, and CRISPR knockdowns, shortening a process that normally took years to months.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I really like Enceladus because it has all the conditions that are at the same place at the time for life to evolve and to thrive.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists announced that Enceladus was likely more habitable after a study found it was emitting a wider array of carbon-based substances than previously known. Researchers said the moon had complex organic molecules, a deep liquid ocean and probable hydrothermal vents, with pH, salinity and temperature within bounds suitable for life. Experts argued that searching exoplanets was more challenging because detectable biosignatures required whole-planet atmospheric changes, transits and could not reveal past life; Nathalie Cabrol concurred.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Instead of the object, all you see is a diffuse fog.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists at Institut Langevin (Paris) and TU Wien (Vienna) developed an acoustic technique that detected hidden objects despite multiple scattering. They recorded a “fingerprint matrix” by measuring how sound scattered from metal spheres, buried those spheres in glass-bead “sand,” remeasured the scattered returns, and used algorithms to correlate the buried returns with the fingerprint. They isolated the spheres’ acoustic signatures and estimated their positions accurately. Researchers suggested the approach could extend to other sensed properties and medical imaging.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““This makes it look to us as if the cube had been rotated.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at TU Wien and the University of Vienna recreated the Terrell–Penrose effect and made relativistic appearance changes visible. Published in Communications Physics, they combined pulsed lasers and time-delayed high-speed photography to 'slice' reflections and assemble composites, effectively slowing light to about 2 m/s. The experiment confirmed historical predictions (Lampa 1924; Penrose and Terrell later) that fast-moving objects appeared rotated: a cube looked twisted while a sphere remained spherical with its pole displaced. They suggested the method could probe other relativistic observations.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Angry Tortoise—a new, lower-cost hypersonic missile”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The U.S. had lagged in the hypersonic arms race while China and Russia reportedly fielded multiple operational hypersonic weapons, some possibly nuclear. The Air Force Research Laboratory unveiled Angry Tortoise, a lower-cost hypersonic missile slated for a December test at White Sands. It used Ursa Major’s Draper engine—a 4,000‑lb‑thrust, hydrogen‑peroxide/kerosene liquid design with room‑temperature storability, multi‑restart capability, and about 60% 3D‑printed parts. Earlier U.S. hypersonic programs had experienced high-profile failures.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“flight over Xanthe Terra”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Mars Express had studied Mars for over twenty years and remained ESA's only operational mission. It had produced the most complete map of the Martian atmosphere and composition, studied Phobos, and traced flow channels, delta fans and chaos terrain pointing to past liquid water. A recent film combined HRSC single-orbit mosaics with a digital terrain model to show a flight over Xanthe Terra, highlighted Shalbatan Vallis (~1300 km) and culminated at the 100 km-wide Da Vinci crater.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the late summer ice has declined by about 50% since routine satellite observations began in 1978.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A polar climate scientist described walking on the frozen Arctic off Utqiagvik, encountering rubble and hidden holes, and learning from local hunters who relied on the ice for whales and seals. Their accounts of later freeze-up, earlier breakup, increased coastal erosion, thawing permafrost and sinking infrastructure matched satellite and model data. Historically winter ice had covered the Arctic basin and summer ice about half the ocean; late-summer ice had declined by about 50% since 1978, affecting ecosystems, shipping and warming via albedo loss.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“In this image, you can clearly see the comet's greenish coma.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) was discovered Jan. 3 at Mt. Lemmon Observatory and was weeks away from a close Earth approach on Oct. 21, passing about 55 million miles (89 million km) before reaching perihelion on Nov. 8. It had brightened from magnitude +21.5 in January to about +7, prompting hopes of naked-eye visibility from dark skies (human limit ~+6.5). Astronomers noted its unpredictability, while astrophotographers captured long-exposure images showing a greenish coma and ion tail (Sept. 22 and 25).</p>

  <p class="dek">Using JWST NIRSpec data, an international team led by Masafusa Onoue and Xuheng Ding studied two distant quasars, J2236+0032 and J1512+442, from 12.9 billion years ago. They found host galaxies of roughly 40-60 billion solar masses—unexpectedly massive for an 800-million-year-old Universe—supporting earlier JWST findings of oversized early galaxies and offering insights into how massive black holes shaped early galactic evolution.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Ten people live in space today, but this number will grow.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">World Space Week 2025 was celebrated Oct. 4–10 with the theme &quot;Living in Space.&quot; Established by the United Nations in 1999, WSW had grown into the largest annual space event, with 2,617 activities across more than 90 countries. The celebration commemorated Sputnik and the Outer Space Treaty anniversaries and focused on challenges of off‑Earth living — life support, radiation shielding and crew health — while hosting workshops, exhibits and forums (e.g., Piccadilly mosaic; NASA/Lockheed &quot;Living on the Moon&quot;) to inspire future explorers.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">WHY DO AI DATA CENTERS USE SO MANY RESOURCES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“In AI, you repeatedly perform similar operations.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">AI growth had driven rapid data‑center construction, causing local water shortages and strained power. Generative AI relied on resource‑intensive GPUs—massively parallel processors that consumed more power and produced more heat than CPUs. Industry sources said GPUs activated many units at once and grew more power‑hungry each generation. A Lawrence Berkeley report found data‑center electricity rose from ~60 TWh (2014–16) to 176 TWh by 2023, and their share of US electricity increased from 1.9% to 4.4%, with projections up to 12%.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“mushrooms can make psilocybin in two different ways, using different types of enzymes.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A study led by Dirk Hoffmeister at Friedrich Schiller University Jena found that two unrelated fungi—Inocybe corydalina and Psilocybe—had independently evolved different enzymatic pathways to produce the same psychoactive compound, psilocybin, a first report of convergent evolution within fungi. The work revealed a new lab route for psilocybin production, considered ecological roles such as insect deterrence, and noted renewed medical interest amid limits of current synthetic manufacture.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers produced a vaccine to prevent elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV), a leading cause of death in young Asian elephants. An international team trialled it in adult elephants at Chester Zoo; it was found safe and activated antiviral immune responses. The trial was described as &quot;a landmark moment&quot; and was hoped to pave the way to prevent juvenile deaths from EEHV, a haemorrhagic disease that killed more than 80% of infected calves and caused over 100 deaths in human care.</p>

Kimiya Yui posted photos and noted a busy day. Jonny Kim activated the SHRIMP humidity-recycling payload; Mike Fincke installed Heat Transfer Host 2 and worked on the Fluid Science Laboratory with Kim; and Zena Cardman loaded sample cassettes into ADvanced Space Experiment Processor-4 for pharmaceutical-manufacturing research in microgravity.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Their claims are, a priori, very plausible, and the results are super interesting.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at Meta developed Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), an AI that learned about the world from videos and demonstrated a notion of “surprise” when shown unphysical scenarios. It made no built-in physical assumptions yet began to infer how the world worked. The article contrasted V-JEPA with pixel-space models’ limitations and noted V-JEPA’s predecessor, JEPA, was introduced by Yann LeCun in 2022.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“biological zero-day”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Microsoft-led researchers announced they had discovered and possibly patched a &quot;biological zero-day&quot;—a gap in DNA-order screening that flagged sequences encoding known toxins or viruses. They argued AI protein-design tools could produce distantly related proteins that folded into the same toxic structures yet evaded similarity-based screening. The team used AI to design ricin variants, tested them against ordering-screen software, found a risk of miss-detection, and treated the finding as a zero-day; AI designs remained error-prone and required experimental testing.</p>

  <p class="dek">Scientists investigated a Bulgarian tradition of adding live red wood ants to milk to start yogurt fermentation and published findings in iScience. They replicated the folk method—adding live ants, insulating and burying milk in an ant mound—retrieved it after 26 hours and observed early yogurt with tangy, herbaceous notes. Lab tests showed ants carried lactic and acetic acid bacteria plus formic acid and enzymes; only live ants produced the desired microbial community. Chefs at Alchemist developed culinary recipes using strained ant yogurt.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;accuracy can be increased by a factor of five.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article explained that transit photometry had found most exoplanets but transit depths were tiny and were muddled by stellar variability, increasing uncertainty in planet sizes. A new study showed limb darkening—stellar edges appearing dimmer—biased transit statistics because planets first crossed dimmed limbs, raising uncertainty. By modeling limb darkening from a star’s spectral type and position on the main sequence, the authors reported transit-depth accuracy had been improvable by about fivefold, despite direct limb-darkening measurements existing for only a few stars.</p>

  <p class="dek">Each year the US Space Force's Mission Assignment Board awarded seven national-security launch contracts; SpaceX won five and ULA won two. The Space Force paid SpaceX $714 million (about $143M per mission) and ULA $428 million ($214M per mission), making ULA roughly 50% costlier per launch. ULA's Vulcan had debuted nearly two years earlier and had its first national-security launch in August. Earlier ULA deals had averaged $112–$119M per mission. Blue Origin's New Glenn remained uncertified.</p>
