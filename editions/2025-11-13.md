  <blockquote class="quote">“Euclid offers an unprecedented combination of sharpness and sky coverage.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The ESA Euclid telescope's first Quick Data Release (Q1) imaged more than 1.2 million large galaxies across 63 square degrees (~0.5% of its planned survey), probing structures up to 10 billion light-years to chart cosmic evolution and constrain Dark Energy. Using Euclid's high-resolution data, researchers at MPE identified hundreds of early-type galaxies with secondary nuclei—possible seeds of future supermassive black-hole binaries—and a rare sample of 65 galaxies with highly ionized emission lines, demonstrating Euclid's capability to study galaxy morphology and evolution.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The ability to tow was something they wanted to have on hand.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google and Ford partnered to map the TransAmerica Trail (TAT) for Street View, bringing Google’s trail initiative to one of America’s longest off-road routes. The 5,900+ mile, 13-state route was traversed in 32 days using a Bronco Badlands fitted with a Street View camera and supported by a Ranger Lariat (gear, recovery, towing up to 7,500 lb) and an Expedition Tremor (crew, workstation). Google Maps received the TAT route and Street View imagery, including sections near Lake City and Imogene Pass.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ROGUE GIANT TILTS PLANETARY ORBITS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“a single substellar flyby provides a likely, efficient mechanism”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Textbook models predicted co-planar, near-circular planetary orbits, but Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were slightly more eccentric and tilted. Brown, Rein and Malhotra ran 50,000 20‑Myr simulations and proposed that a rogue planet or brown dwarf (2–50 Jupiter masses) passed through—one successful scenario involved an ~8 Jupiter‑mass object within 1.7 AU at 1–3 km/s. ~1% of runs matched observed orbits; they estimated a ~1-in-9,000 chance in the Sun’s birth cluster. Inner planets remained largely intact.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">IMPOSSIBLE MERGER EXPLAINED BY MAGNETS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“No one has considered these systems the way we did; previously, astronomers just took a shortcut and neglected the magnetic fields.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists resolved the 2023 'impossible' merger GW231123, a collision about 7 billion light-years away between roughly 100- and 140-solar-mass black holes that spun near light speed. Those masses lay inside the expected pair-instability gap (about 70–140 solar masses) and prior mergers were ruled out because the spins remained maximal. Researchers at the Flatiron Institute's CCA simulated progenitor stars through supernovae and found that including magnetic fields let a ~250-solar-mass star slim to ~150 Msun and produce such black holes.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“lineated valley fill (in valleys) or concentric crater fill (in craters)”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Travelling from Mars’s equator toward its north pole, images showed Coloe Fossae — diagonal parallel scars within valleys and craters — and swirling lineated valley fill and concentric crater fill that indicated slow flows of icy debris topped by rock. Although located at 39°N, far from the pole, these features were interpreted as remnants of a Martian ice age driven by axial-tilt–induced climate shifts, when ice advanced to mid-latitudes and later retreated, possibly as recently as 0.5 million years ago.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MATHEMATICIANS BATTLE SOAP FILM SINGULARITIES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“They’re very beautiful objects to study.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Joseph Plateau had dipped wire loops in soap to study films, proposing they minimized area. Douglas and Radó proved in the 1930s that every closed curve in three-dimensional space bounded an area-minimizing surface, earning Douglas a Fields Medal. Mathematicians extended this work, finding Plateau’s claim held up through dimension seven, but in higher dimensions minimizing surfaces could develop singularities (folds, pinches, self-intersections). Researchers sought how common such singularities were and whether small boundary perturbations could eliminate them.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““it’s caused by a CME.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers using ESA’s XMM-Newton and the LOFAR radio telescope definitively detected a coronal mass ejection (CME) from a red dwarf about 130 light‑years away. A short, intense low‑frequency radio burst—identified with new LOFAR processing—and XMM‑Newton X‑ray data showed material had escaped the star’s magnetic bubble. The CME moved at about 2400 km/s, a rare solar-comparable speed, and was dense and fast enough to strip atmospheres from closely orbiting planets, marking the first confirmed CME sighting on another star.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;New Glenn is ready to launch.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin’s second-flight New Glenn launch was postponed after a supercharged wave of magnetized plasma from the Sun enveloped Earth. NASA had delayed the mission to send two ESCAPADE Mars science probes because elevated solar activity and a coronal mass ejection—arriving after a bright flare and moving at over 1 million mph—could expose the spacecraft to high-energy particles that might disrupt electronics. Blue Origin said New Glenn was ready to launch; no new date was set.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">GOVERNMENT MOVES TO AXE ANIMAL TESTS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Can we get very close to it? I think we can.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The government set out how it aimed to fulfil its manifesto pledge to work toward phasing out animal testing. Plans included replacing some major safety tests by the end of the year and reducing use of dogs and non-human primates in human-medicine tests by at least 35% by 2030. Animal experiments had peaked at 4.14 million in 2015 and fallen to 2.88 million by 2020 but then plateaued. Science Minister Lord Vallance wanted to revive the decline by using stem-cell-derived tissues, AI and computer simulations.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“At this point, we do not think there’s much of a chance for natural recovery.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists found the 2023 marine heat wave caused functional extinction of two Acropora reef-building species across the Florida Reef. The heat wave, 2.2–4× stronger than prior events, killed corals by forcing symbiotic microalgae to produce toxic reactive oxygen that led to bleaching. Acropora — primary, fast-growing reef builders — suffered near-total mortality (100% in Dry Tortugas; 98–100% in the Keys; ~90% in Biscayne; 38% in Miami/Broward), and researchers judged natural recovery unlikely.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">IBM LAUNCHES QUANTUM DUEL NIGHTHAWK LOON</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“execute circuits with 30 percent more complexity”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">IBM announced two quantum chips, Nighthawk and Loon, intended to help demonstrate quantum advantage by the end of 2026. Nighthawk was designed for iterative development and by the end of 2025 would be delivered with 120 qubits and 218 tunable couplers in a square lattice, which IBM said would allow it to execute circuits with 30 percent more complexity and handle up to 5,000 two‑qubit gates. Loon experimented with vertical as well as horizontal qubit links. IBM also joined a community-led quantum advantage tracker.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">COMMON VIRUS PINPOINTED AS LUPUS TRIGGER</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We think it applies to 100% of lupus cases.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A common childhood virus appeared to trigger lupus, researchers reported. The study implicated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) — which infected most people and took up residence in B cells — as prompting immune cells to ‘go rogue’ so autoreactive B cells attacked the body’s tissues. Authors said the finding could explain all lupus cases, revolutionise treatment and spur a search for an EBV vaccine; lupus affected about 69,000 people in the UK.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SUPERBUG DEATHS SOAR 17%</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest health threats we face.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">UKHSA figures showed deaths linked to antibiotic‑resistant infections in England rose 17% in 2024 (2,041 to 2,379). Nearly 400 newly reported resistant infections occurred weekly; resistant bacteraemia rose 9.3% (18,740 to 20,484). Private antibiotic dispensing more than doubled and reached 22% of prescriptions in 2024, partly attributed to the Pharmacy First scheme. NHS primary‑care antibiotic use fell 2019–24, but overall primary‑care use rose 10.7% over five years. The report warned resistance, driven by natural selection, could cause up to 10 million deaths by 2050.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The Falcon 9’s established failure rate is less than 1 percent.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">At Cape Canaveral a Falcon 9 launched 29 Starlink satellites, marking the 94th orbital launch from Florida’s Space Coast in 2025 and breaking that spaceport’s calendar-year record. Two days earlier a Long March 11 from an oceangoing platform made humanity’s 255th orbital mission of the year, and by Wednesday global launches had reached 259, putting 2025 on pace for about 300 launches. The rise was linked to reusable rocketry and SpaceX’s strong Falcon 9 reliability.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Loon represents two major changes for the company.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Companies made incremental year‑end quantum announcements. IBM confirmed two processors: Loon, using a square nearest‑neighbor grid plus long‑distance links for error‑corrected logical qubits, and Nighthawk, a square nearest‑neighbor device without long links focused on lowering error rates to test quantum‑advantage algorithms. IBM launched a GitHub repo for algorithm performance data and said its error‑correction algorithm ran in real time on an AMD FPGA. IonQ reported &gt;99.99% two‑qubit gate fidelity using Oxford Ionics' methods.</p>

  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed a nanometer-thick, lightweight 2D polyaramid film that was nearly impenetrable to gases such as nitrogen, suggesting use as protective coatings to prevent corrosion and to slow aging of packaged food and medicines. The impermeability rivaled graphene despite the polymer being produced in solution and not a perfect crystal. The scalable coating was reported in Nature; senior authors were Michael Strano and Scott Bunch, and lead authors included Cody Ritt, Michelle Quien, and Zitang Wei.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“landing represents a primary mission objective rather than a bonus goal.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin bought and converted a 180 m roll-on/roll-off ferry named Jacklyn but abandoned that conversion in 2022 and scrapped the ship. It instead built a purpose-built, unpowered 116×45 m barge also named Jacklyn (Landing Platform Vessel 1) with autonomous recovery systems and an RROV. The platform was involved in New Glenn’s January 2025 maiden flight, which failed during descent; by the second mission, carrying NASA’s ESCAPADE probes, landing was declared a primary objective after propellant and hardware fixes.</p>

  <p class="dek">Anthropic researchers ran Project Fetch to test whether their Claude coding model could help program a Unitree Go2 robot dog. Two teams—one using Claude, one coding unaided—were asked to complete tasks; the Claude-assisted team completed some tasks faster and achieved behaviors (walking and finding a beach ball) the human-only team did not. Anthropic analyzed team interactions, finding more confusion and negative sentiment without Claude and noting implications for AI extending into physical systems.</p>

  <p class="dek">A powerful geomagnetic storm lit up skies across much of the US late Tuesday and early Wednesday, with the aurora borealis reported in more than a dozen states—from New York and Washington to Texas, Tennessee and others—and photos posted from many states. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center issued a G4 (severe) watch for 11–12 November after fast-moving CMEs; two CMEs already reached Earth at G4 strength and a third, expected around midday ET Wednesday, was forecast as the final and most energetic.</p>

  <p class="dek">Scientists captured for the first time the shockwave breakout of supernova 2024ggi on April 10, 2024, in NGC 3621, 22 million light-years away. Yi Yang and an international team used ESO’s VLT 26 hours after discovery by ATLAS to observe the shock crossing a 12–15 solar-mass red supergiant (~500 solar radii). Polarization of the unresolved light revealed a surprisingly symmetrical explosion geometry, informing supernova and stellar-collapse models.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Our planet was hit by two consecutive CMEs last night triggering a severe geomagnetic disturbance.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On 11 November 2025 an X5.1 solar flare peaked at ~10:04 UTC and, within an hour, a CME with initial speed ≈1500 km/s was observed; arrival at Earth was estimated late 12 November or early 13 November with uncertainty. Two earlier X-class flares had produced CMEs that hit Earth and triggered a G4 severe geomagnetic storm. ESA monitored the event, warned of possible impacts to satellites, power grids and GNSS across sunlit regions (Europe, Africa, Asia), noted no direct biological risk, and expected continued activity.</p>

  <p class="dek">The AI boom had driven urgent innovation in chip networking as companies and startups pursued faster links from on-chip interconnects to rack-to-rack connections. Venture capital flowed into photonics startups (Lightmatter, Celestial AI, PsiQuantum) after investors judged electron-based interconnects insufficient. Nvidia's earlier Mellanox and Cumulus acquisitions were credited for foresight, Broadcom prepared a Thor Ultra networking chip and pursued silicon photonics, and ARM announced plans to buy DreamBig for $265 million to scale chiplet networking.</p>
