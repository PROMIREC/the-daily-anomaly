  <blockquote class="quote">“The tungsten-wall environment is far more challenging than using carbon.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Tungsten (W) was reported as a promising tokamak material. In April 2024 the Korea Institute of Fusion Energy said KSTAR sustained plasma at 100 million °C thanks to a tungsten divertor, and France’s WEST tokamak, clad in tungsten, sustained 50 million °C for six minutes at higher energies and densities than carbon-walled predecessors. Carbon retained fuel and impeded tritium breeding, while tungsten risked cooling the plasma if eroded. WEST used a hybrid photon-counting ME-SXR camera for X-ray diagnostics under the CICLOP/IAEA program.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This is a tale of a failed galaxy.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported the first confirmed starless dark-matter halo predicted by Lambda-CDM: a Reionization-Limited H I Cloud (RELHIC) named Cloud 9 near Messier 94. Initially detected by FAST, Hubble ACS imaging found no stars, though Cloud 9 contained about one million solar masses of neutral hydrogen. The discovery, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters (lead author Gagandeep Anand), supported the view that reionization and the cosmic UV background prevented galaxy formation below a dark-matter threshold (~10^9.7 ≈ 5×10^9 solar masses).</p>

  <p class="dek">Meta had commercialized EMG in 2025 with its Meta Ray‑Ban Display glasses controlled by a wrist neural band. At CES 2026 it showed demos of the band controlling devices beyond glasses, partnering with Garmin on a Unified Cabin concept where pinch and swipe gestures navigated a touchscreen car model and played 2048; Garmin said it would explore vehicle functions like rolling down windows and unlocking doors. Meta also announced a University of Utah research collaboration to test wrist‑gesture control for people with ALS and mobility use.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It's like having a garden.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Satellite images and an animation from June 2022 to July 2023 showed vivid green algal blooms forming, drifting across, and fading in South Africa’s Hartbeespoortdam reservoir. The animation used Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery combining Landsat 8/9 and Sentinel‑2A/B/C. The blooms indicated harmful algal blooms (HABs) driven by eutrophication from excess nutrients (e.g., agricultural runoff); die-off and decomposition had caused hypoxia and dead zones. Hartbeespoortdam, 25 km west of Pretoria, had recurring cyanobacterial HABs and invasive water hyacinths that worsened eutrophication.</p>

  <p class="dek">NASA’s SPHEREx Observatory mapped the entire sky in 102 infrared colors. The image showed colors tracing emission from stars, hot hydrogen gas, and cosmic dust. Though invisible to the eye, these wavelengths were prevalent and enabled scientists to probe how an event in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang influenced 3D distribution of hundreds of millions of galaxies, to study galaxy evolution over 14 billion years, and to map ingredients for life in our galaxy.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“this is like looking at a platypus.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A University of Missouri team combed the James Webb Space Telescope archives and identified nine point-like galaxies from 12–12.6 billion years ago that combined previously unseen features. From an initial ~2,000 sources, their spectra did not match known categories: they were too distant to be stars, too faint to be quasars, yet had narrow, sharp emission-line peaks indicating slower gas. They resembled “green pea” galaxies but were far more compact; low-resolution spectra could not rule out star formation. The results were presented at the AAS meeting.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““This is a tale of a failed galaxy.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A team using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope uncovered Cloud-9, the first confirmed Reionization-Limited H I Cloud (RELHIC): a starless, gas-rich, dark-matter-dominated relic of early galaxy formation. Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys showed no stars, distinguishing it from faint dwarf galaxies. Cloud-9’s neutral-hydrogen core was about 4,900 light-years across and contained ~1×10^6 solar masses of hydrogen, while the system was inferred to be dominated by ~5×10^9 solar masses of dark matter. It was compact, spherical, and atypical compared with other nearby hydrogen clouds.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Cas13 can target these RNA viruses and inactivate them,&quot; Zhao explained.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Wei Zhao presented a proposal from the Peter Doherty Institute to use CRISPR—specifically Cas13—to treat and prevent influenza. They planned lipid-nanoparticle delivery of mRNA encoding Cas13 plus guide RNAs via a nasal spray or injection to respiratory cells; Cas13 would cut viral RNA and halt replication. They aimed guides at conserved influenza regions to reduce resistance that limited drugs like Tamiflu. Sharon Lewin led the project.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Sextans A is giving us a blueprint for the first dusty galaxies,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers detected metallic iron dust, silicon carbide (SiC), and small carbon-molecule clumps in the low-metallicity dwarf galaxy Sextans A (≈4 million light-years, 3–7% solar metallicity). MIRI spectroscopy of several asymptotic giant branch stars identified an iron-only dust-producing high-mass AGB star and SiC from lower-mass AGBs, showing that evolved stars and the interstellar medium could form solid grains under early-universe–like conditions and revised ideas about early galaxy dust production.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“ground-state energy, or zero-point energy”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Quantum mechanics said that even an apparently empty box retained ground-state (zero-point) energy in both field and particle forms. It could not be eliminated because the Heisenberg uncertainty principle prevented fixing position and velocity simultaneously, so particles showed a measurable spread and appeared to jiggle. Interpretations differed on whether that motion was real. Max Planck introduced zero-point energy in 1911; Einstein later took it seriously and used it to explain molecular and lattice vibrations and helium’s refusal to solidify at ordinary pressure.</p>

  <p class="dek">On 5 January 2026 the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne hosted an astronaut-tree planting by ESA astronaut Sophie Adenot to mark her first mission, εpsilon. She planted an American sweetgum whose autumn red leaves evoked rocket flames. Adenot had been selected as an ESA career astronaut in 2022 and was training for εpsilon, scheduled to launch no earlier than 15 February 2026, a long-duration ISS mission for European experiments, medical research, Earth observation and station operations. The planting continued an ESA tradition adapted from Kazakhstan.</p>

  <p class="dek">On Dec. 24 SpaceX posted a photo showing a Super Heavy booster standing in a high bay at its Starbase facility in South Texas and captioned it 'Stacking complete.' The booster was intended for Starship Flight 12, which SpaceX had not dated but expected in the first quarter; the schedule had slipped after an earlier booster buckled during tests in late November. Flight 12 was planned to use the taller Version 3 Starship and the new Raptor 3 engine.</p>

  <p class="dek">Scientists questioned what physics occurred inside black holes. Cosimo Bambi proposed in iScience that gram-scale nanocrafts propelled by light could be sent to a nearby black hole to take and transmit data before destruction. He argued such missions could test general relativity and event horizons but faced huge obstacles—costs, century-plus timelines, lacking spacecraft tech and no suitably close black hole—yet he recommended planning now and suggested launches might be feasible in 20–30 years. Breakthrough Starshot light-sail work and Richard Norte’s research were relevant.</p>

  <p class="dek">The article opened a series on the physics of free will and recounted Benjamin Libet’s 1980s experiment: volunteers flicked their wrists at will while researchers measured a “readiness potential” and had them note when they felt the conscious urge. The readiness potential began about one‑fifth of a second before subjects reported awareness. The author said there was no settled interpretation, listed alternative explanations, identified himself as a cosmologist not a neuroscientist, and urged caution about definitive physics claims.</p>

  <p class="dek">Google DeepMind teamed up with Boston Dynamics to deploy its Gemini Robotics model on Boston Dynamics robots, including humanoid Atlas and dog-like Spot, and planned tests of Gemini-powered Atlas at Hyundai auto factories in the coming months. The partnership aimed to give humanoids contextual awareness and object-manipulation ability, addressing Atlas’s current intelligence limitations. The article noted Boston Dynamics’ ownership history, growing global humanoid competition, a recent DeepMind hire from Boston Dynamics, and Demis Hassabis’s platform vision for Gemini.</p>

The trail altered Betelgeuse's spectrum and became visible every six years when Siwarha crossed between Betelgeuse and Earth. The companion had been identified in July 2025; the wake detection was presented at the 247th AAS meeting and the study was set to appear in The Astrophysical Journal, with Siwarha expected visible again in 2027.</p>

  <p class="dek">Astronomers discovered the first spatially resolved, gravitationally lensed supernova, SN 2025wny, located 10 billion light-years away and exploding when the Universe was about 4 billion years old. Led by Joel Johansson (Oskar Klein Centre), teams using ZTF, the Nordic Optical Telescope, the Liverpool Telescope and Keck found that two foreground galaxies magnified the event by about 50× and split it into multiple images. The observation supported General Relativity and offered a probe of dark matter and the Hubble Constant via light-travel time delays.</p>

  <p class="dek">Samsung Display and Intel had developed SmartPower HDR, which adjusted the driving voltage to reduce OLED power use while playing HDR content. The laptop chipset monitored each frame’s peak brightness in real time, and the panel’s timing controller used that plus the active-pixel ratio to choose an optimal voltage. Samsung said the tech cut OLED emission power by up to 22% in general use and up to 17% during HDR; it was unclear which laptops would get it.</p>

  <p class="dek">The Huíla plateau in southwestern Angola rose abruptly above coastal plains to about 2,300 meters, creating a serrated edge that marked a sharp shift from arid lowlands to more-temperate highlands. A mosaic of Landsat 8 and 9 OLI/OLI-2 scenes from June 19–20, 2025, and VIIRS imagery showed green vegetation near the plateau edges that turned browner by late September after the dry season. The Great Escarpment spanned ~5,000 km, lay 50–200 km inland from the coast, and featured Tundavala Gap, scenic hairpin roads, and the city of Lubango in a plateau valley.</p>
