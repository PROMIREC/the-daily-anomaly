  <h3 class="hed">VALAR CLAIMS FIRST NUCLEAR CRITICALITY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Zero power criticality is a reactor’s first heartbeat, proof the physics holds.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Startup Valar Atomics said it achieved zero-power (cold) criticality—the initial sustained fission reaction—and claimed to be the first nuclear startup to reach criticality. The test combined Valar’s fuel and technology with structural components from Los Alamos National Laboratory and took place under a DOE pilot program, created after a Trump executive order, that aimed to get at least three startups to criticality by July 4. Valar had raised $130 million, used relatively untested fuel, and planned a full reactor by next July.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Ya está abierto el plazo de acreditación de medios de comunicación.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Se abrió el plazo de acreditación para el lanzamiento de Artemis II, previsto para principios de 2026. La misión de prueba llevaría a Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch y Jeremy Hansen en un vuelo lunar de aproximadamente 10 días desde Kennedy en la nave Orion con el cohete SLS, para validar sistemas y hardware de exploración. Se establecieron plazos de solicitud (no estadounidenses: 30 nov; estadounidenses: 8 dic); las solicitudes debían enviarse en https://media.ksc.nasa.gov; se proporcionaron el correo ksc-media-accreditat@mail.nasa.gov y el teléfono +1 321-867-2468.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It’s not a Jedi mind trick.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Research suggested that neural coupling—when two or more brains synchronized—underlay the uncanny &quot;click&quot; people sometimes felt and shaped everyday communication. Uri Hasson described brains as wireless transmitters and said communication was a single act performed by two brains, not literal telepathy. Studies reported coupling during chess, collaborative music, kissing (2014 PLOS One found stronger inter-brain connection when heterosexual couples kissed lips versus hands), remote video-game collaboration (2022), and infant–adult play (2019 Psychological Science), which disappeared when infants disengaged.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“point of no return”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">European and Brazilian researchers carried out an ESA-funded campaign, Carbon Amazon Rainforest Activity, to reduce uncertainty about Amazon greenhouse-gas fluxes. The Committee on Earth Observing Satellites had flagged the region as a potential near-future 'point of no return'. Teams led by King’s College London and the UK’s National Centre for Earth Observation collected ground, tower, drone and low-flying aircraft measurements across a 100 km by 100 km area in western Pará to assess whether parts of the forest were shifting from carbon sink to source.</p>

  <p class="dek">After 204 days in orbit, Commander Chen Dong and crewmates Chen Zhongrui and Wang Jie returned to Earth aboard the newer Shenzhou 21 spacecraft, landing at the Dongfeng zone in the Gobi Desert. Chinese officials halted the original Shenzhou 20 departure when analyses found a minor crack in its return-capsule window, likely caused by small space debris, and deemed it unsafe. Three astronauts—Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang—remained aboard Tiangong with the damaged Shenzhou 20 as the only available lifeboat.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the company is targeting June 2026 for the first orbital refueling demonstration between Starship vehicles”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA may have had no choice but to postpone its Artemis 3 crewed lunar-landing mission to 2028 after SpaceX's Starship development fell behind schedule. An internal SpaceX document obtained by Politico targeted June 2026 for an orbital refueling demonstration, June 2027 for an uncrewed lunar landing, and September 2028 as the earliest crewed-surface attempt if tests succeeded. SpaceX planned to provide an integrated master schedule to NASA in December; Starship had mixed 2025 test results but showed Block 2 improvements.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ANCIENT STAR FACTORY 180X MILKY WAY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We're looking back to a time when the universe was making stars much faster than today.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers discovered a superheated star-forming galaxy, Y1, that existed about 800 million years after the Big Bang and was observed as it was 13 billion years ago. Using ALMA Band 9 they measured dust temperature around −180°C and found the galaxy formed stars at about 180 solar masses per year (roughly 180 times the Milky Way). The team said such extreme, short-lived starbursts could have been common and helped early galaxies grow quickly.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ICEYE BUILDS EUROPE'S EYE IN SKY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“You needed independent capabilities and a strong alliance.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Finland’s ICEYE said it had a major role in giving Europe sovereign access to satellite intelligence without relying on the United States. European interest rose after Russia’s 2022 invasion and the U.S. paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine in March 2025, which underscored the need for independent capabilities. ICEYE had signed contracts with Poland, Portugal, the Netherlands and Finland, delivered a Dutch satellite within four months, and aimed to field multiple satellites and operational capabilities by 2028 as it shifted toward being a defense‑intelligence integrator.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Media accreditation was open for the launch of the first crewed Moon mission under NASA’s Artemis campaign.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Media accreditation was opened for the Artemis II crewed Moon mission launch, targeted for early 2026. The roughly 10-day test flight would have carried NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen aboard Orion on the SLS from Kennedy Space Center to validate deep-space systems. International media had to apply by Nov. 30 and U.S. media by Dec. 8 (annual badge holders also required to apply). Accredited press were eligible for pre-launch events; space was limited.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““Today’s decision to rescind the order reflects the steady decline in staffing concerns across the NAS and allows us to return to normal operations,””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The FAA rescinded an order that had restricted commercial launches to nighttime after a government shutdown reduced air traffic control staffing. The directive, imposed Nov. 10 to avoid airspace closures around spaceports in Florida, California and Delmarva, ended Nov. 17 at 6 a.m. EST, allowing normal National Airspace System operations to resume. SpaceX was chiefly affected but launched four after-hours missions; NASA's ESCAPADE received a daytime exemption.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“are up to 100 million times stronger than the lunar gravity”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Slava Turyshev updated understanding of lunar dust, reporting jagged particles with cohesion (van der Waals forces up to 100 million times lunar gravity) which stuck to and damaged equipment. Dust conductivity altered antennas—acting as a dielectric load in Maria and as a capacitive detuner in Highlands. PSR dust had low conductivity, causing electrostatic buildup and discharge risks. ChaSTE showed surface dust insulated radiators while subsurface regolith conducted heat better; NILS detected a dayside charged-hydrogen layer that modified the plasma sheath and enabled electrostatic hopping.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DEEPMIND STUNS WITH WEATHER BREAKTHROUGH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It gives you a more granular forecast.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">DeepMind released WeatherNext 2, which delivered more efficient, accurate, higher-resolution global forecasts. It provided hourly forecasts and temperature and pressure predictions up to two weeks, and improved tropical storm tracks accurate up to three days (versus two days previously). The model was eight times faster by using a single processing step instead of repeated image/video-style processing, reducing compute needs. DeepMind said it helped energy traders but likely struggled with outlier rain and snow due to training-data gaps; competitors included NVIDIA, Microsoft, AccuWeather and Huawei.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“planets are common around nearby stars in our Galaxy, but little is known about planets that formed outside the Milky Way.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists had targeted exoplanets mainly around Milky Way disk stars, finding more than 6,000, but noted a bias toward Sun-like metallicities. The VOYAGERS survey (Views Of Yore – Ancient Gaia-enceladus Exoplanet Revealing Survey), led by Robert Aloisi and published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, was described to search for planets around remnant stars of the Gaia‑Enceladus merger (8–11 billion years ago) to test whether low‑metallicity, high‑alpha environments produced different planets.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“So far there is no hint telling us that we should throw quantum field theory away; actually, it’s the opposite.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A 1977 theory called quadratic gravity had been sidelined because it implied a negative-energy “ghost” particle, but researchers revived it by applying standard quantum field theory to gravity. Proponents, including Luca Buoninfante, argued QFT remained viable, that quadratic gravity produced new, untested predictions, and that ghosts and possible microscopic causality violations might be mathematically consistent rather than fatal paradoxes.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““A screening programme saves more of the man, and gives us a better and cheaper means of saving that man.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Junior Hemans was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014 at 51 after requesting a PSA test during a routine check; the NHS did not routinely offer PSA testing. He argued a national screening programme targeted at high‑risk groups, including black men, could have diagnosed cases earlier. Prostate cancer had become the most commonly diagnosed cancer in England with over 55,000 new cases annually; lifetime risk was one in eight men and one in four for black men. The NSC was due to decide on screening.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MINIMAL DATA GUARANTEES OPTIMAL CHOICES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Data are one of the most important aspects of the AI economy.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed an algorithmic framework that identified the smallest dataset guaranteeing an optimal decision under uncertainty. Using a subway-route example, the method considered problem structure (network, constraints, budget) and cost uncertainty to select minimal measurement locations and how to use them to find the least expensive route, often needing fewer studies than conventional approaches. The framework applied to structured decision problems such as supply chains and electricity networks. Authors included Asu Ozdaglar, Omar and Amine Bennouna, and Saurabh Amin; results were presented at NeurIPS.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">EVOLUTION DIDN'T STOP; HUMANS STILL EVOLVE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Like other living creatures, humans have been shaped by evolution.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Michael A. Little, an anthropologist, explained that although some believed humans had conquered nature and stopped evolving, humans had been and were still evolving. He described adaptation as traits that conferred advantages; individuals with those traits were more likely to survive and pass them to their children, and over many generations those traits became widespread. The piece appeared in The Conversation's Curious Kids series.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“2024 YR4 was officially listed as a 3 on the Torino scale.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Maxime Devogèle of ESA’s NEO Coordination Centre and colleagues analyzed a dry run around asteroid 2024 YR4, discovered on December 27, 2024 by the ATLAS survey. Their arXiv preprint walked through discovery, classification, escalation, scientific response and de-escalation. In early January 2025 headlines followed as additional observations—unlike 99.9% of discoveries—increased impact probability; on January 27 it was listed Torino scale 3, peaking at a 3.1% impact chance on February 18. The warning system largely worked; Apophis had earlier reached Torino 4 in 2004.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“How such a shock is launched and propagates through the star is a decade-long puzzle.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope observed Type II supernova SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621 about 22 million light-years away only 26 hours after its explosion, capturing spectropolarimetric data and the shock breakout as it breached the star’s surface. The study, led by Yi Yang and published in Science Advances, identified an axisymmetric shock breakout, provided insight into explosion geometry and shock propagation, and confirmed the progenitor was a red supergiant between 12 and 15 solar masses first detected by ATLAS on 10 April 2024.</p>

It followed Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (2020) and served as the reference radar altimetry mission to continue the sea-surface height record until at least 2030. Its main instrument was the ESA-developed Poseidon-4 dual-frequency radar altimeter, which measured sea-surface height, significant wave height and wind speed.</p>

  <p class="dek">Kirt Stallings waited in a transport vehicle before boarding a NASA ER‑2 for a high‑altitude mission supporting the Geological Earth Mapping Experiment (GEMx). GEMx was a multi‑year NASA–USGS campaign to map critical mineral resources across the Western U.S.; the team believed some of the 50 essential mineral commodities remained undiscovered domestically. In 2025 the ER‑2 flew 36 missions, collected over seven billion measurements in 200 flight hours, creating the largest airborne surface mineralogy dataset; pilots flew about 65,000 feet wearing pressure suits.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers at Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg (JMU) had for the first time controlled a satellite's attitude in orbit using an autonomous AI system. The In-Orbit Demonstrator for Learning Attitude Control (LeLaR) used deep reinforcement learning trained in a high-fidelity simulator and was uploaded to the InnoCube nanosatellite in low Earth orbit. On Oct. 30 the flight controller autonomously reoriented the satellite via reaction wheels to a set target attitude; the team repeated the maneuver on subsequent passes.</p>
