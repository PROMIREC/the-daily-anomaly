  <blockquote class="quote">“Our study provides a new direction to understand the whole evolutionary history of massive stars toward the formation of black hole binaries.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers observed supernova SN 2022esa with the Subaru and Seimei telescopes and interpreted it as the explosive death of a Wolf-Rayet star in galaxy 2MFGC 13525 about 320 million light-years away. The supernova showed a clear, stable month-long period and implied yearly pre-explosion eruptions, which the team said required a binary companion — either a black hole or a massive star that would form one — yielding a future binary black hole.</p>

  <p class="dek">On January 10 in Huntsville, Alabama, NASA demolished two historic test stands—the Propulsion and Structural Test Facility (“T-tower,” built 1957) and the Dynamic Test Stand (built 1964)—in orchestrated implosions. The T-tower had supported static tests, including F‑1 engines for Saturn V and Shuttle booster tests; the Dynamic Stand tested full Saturn V structural and vibration loads, later integrated Space Shuttle elements, and served microgravity experiments. Both National Historic Landmarks were removed for safety and campus modernization; archival records and LiDAR models preserved their legacy.</p>

  <p class="dek">Satellite-based maps showed wildland fires in the far north became more frequent and widespread as temperatures rose and lightning reached higher latitudes. Comparison maps for 2002–2012 and 2012–2024 indicated wildfires that had been scattered across the Arctic surged in number—especially in northern Eurasia—and many burned more intensely than before.</p>

  <p class="dek">A Sejong University team analyzed 26,500 wide binaries within 650 lightyears using Gaia data and reported that at very low orbital accelerations (~0.1 nm/s^2) observed accelerations were about 30–40% higher than Newton–Einstein predictions, while systems above ~10 nm/s^2 agreed with standard theory. The authors said the result, published in The Astrophysical Journal, matched MOND/AQUAL predictions (including a 1.4× boost) but noted MOND remained theoretical and needed more observational support.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Our study provides a new direction to understand the whole evolutional history of massive stars toward the formation of black hole binaries.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at Kyoto University observed SN 2022esa, a rare type Ic-CSM supernova from an extremely massive, luminous star, and found it exploded brightly while forming a black hole, contradicting assumptions that very massive stars collapsed quietly. They measured a clear, stable ~one-month periodicity in its light curve, implying regular pre-explosion eruptions driven by a binary companion; the team concluded the system likely produced a black hole binary. Observations combined Seimei and Subaru telescope data.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;It is the very first example [from string theory] of an explicit de Sitter space,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 1998 astronomers discovered dark energy, which complicated efforts to find string-theory models of our accelerating universe because well-understood string constructions produced negative or zero energy (anti-de Sitter or flat space). Last year Bruno Bento and Miguel Montero presented a precise, simplified formula showing how string theory could produce a de Sitter universe with dark energy that weakened over time, in line with recent preliminary observations. Their solution, however, was five-dimensional rather than the four-dimensional universe we inhabit.</p>

  <p class="dek">Scientists reported a proton-rich &quot;island of inversion&quot; by studying molybdenum isotopes Mo-84 (Z=N=42) and Mo-86 (Z=42, N=44). They found adding two neutrons induced particle–hole excitations and strong deformation in Mo-84, challenging the expectation that such islands occurred only in neutron-rich nuclei. The team produced fragments by bombarding a beryllium target with accelerated Mo-92 ions, used Mo-86 to produce Mo-84 which emitted gamma rays measured with GRETINA and TRIPLEX, revealing nuclear deformation. Results appeared in Nature Communications.</p>

  <p class="dek">Sentinel-2A, launched in 2015 with a 13-band multispectral imager and a 290 km swath, had delivered high-resolution land and coastal imagery for Copernicus and also returned data on marine biology, methane and polar ice. Although the Sentinel-2 pair (2B in 2017, 2C in 2024) were designed to image using sunlight and were normally switched off at night, engineers used Sentinel-2A near end-of-life to trial nighttime imaging; the trials were strikingly positive and encouraged the Sentinel-2 Next Generation plan to image at night over certain regions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It's the intensity that worries us the most.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA researchers reported that wildland fires in the Arctic had increased and were burning larger, hotter, and longer, trends linked to rapid Arctic warming—nearly four times the global average—which reduced snow, rain, and soil moisture and pushed lightning farther north. A 2025 AMAP report (lead author Jessica McCarty) found fires were acting more extremely; Tatiana Loboda said fire intensity had the most profound ecosystem impacts. The article described Arctic ecosystems and how seasonal thawing made vegetation flammable when struck by lightning.</p>

The paper, led by graduate student Jia Yi Zhang with senior author Mei Hong and coauthor Aurelio Dregni, appeared in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. The fuzzy coat comprised about 80% of Tau and influenced interactions relevant to Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Researchers found no evidence that the outflow cavities were growing as the protostar moved through the later stages of star formation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Hubble imaged protostars in the Orion Molecular Cloud (about 1,300 light-years away), showing envelopes of gas and dust, outflow cavities, jets and reflected light. Researchers used three new images to survey protostellar envelopes and found no evidence that outflow cavities grew as protostars evolved; they concluded declining accretion and low star-formation rates could not be explained by progressive clearing of envelopes. Specific objects included HOPS 181 and HOPS 310 (which carved a large cavity) and the bright star CVSO 188.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We're seeing what could be described as an energetic tug-of-war inside the black hole's accretion flow.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers studied the black hole binary 4U 1630−472 with NASA's NICER and MeerKAT over three years and found it alternated between high-energy jets and X-ray winds, never producing both simultaneously. The accretion disk and mass supply stayed consistent while jets and winds competed for the same material, carried similar mass and energy, and implied a roughly steady outflow and self-regulation. The team proposed the switch depended on the accretion-disk magnetic-field configuration, not the accretion rate.</p>

GISS used data from over 25,000 stations, ship and buoy sea measurements, and Antarctic stations, with adjustments for station distribution and urban heating. NOAA, Berkeley Earth, the Hadley Centre and Copernicus concluded 2025 was the third warmest, using similar data and different methods showing ongoing warming.</p>

DNA testing identified the meat as Coelodonta antiquitatis, and despite degradation and wolf-DNA contamination the team reconstructed a full genome that showed no long runs of homozygosity, indicating a genetically healthy, non-inbred population centuries before extinction. A separate 49,000-year-old genome revealed an effective-population drop to about 1,600 between 114,000 and 63,000 years ago.</p>

In macaque tasks offering larger water rewards paired with an air blast, activation of the ventral striatum sent inhibitory signals to the ventral pallidum and reduced task initiation. Chemogenetic disruption restored motivation only for punished trials. Authors linked this mechanism to everyday task avoidance and clinical apathy, noting it protected against burnout.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;They have an almost perfect disguise that removes X-ray and radio emission.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using JWST, astronomers discovered 'little red dots' in 2022 that appeared less than 1 billion years after the Big Bang and faded by 2 billion years. Debate considered star-rich galaxies or supermassive black holes, but both seemed too massive and lacked X-ray/radio emission. A study of 12 objects (earliest at ~840 million years) found they were too luminous and compact for starlight—sources as bright as &gt;250 billion suns within &lt;0.33 light-years—and were interpreted as supermassive black holes enshrouded in ionized-gas cocoons.</p>
