  <blockquote class="quote">“Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multidecade dataset for sea level measurements from space.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Sentinel-6B was scheduled to launch no earlier than 12:21 a.m. EST on Nov. 17 and was the latest in a series of satellites that had measured sea surface height since 1992. It began cross-calibration with Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich and was the second satellite of the Copernicus Sentinel-6/Jason-CS mission, a NASA–ESA–EUMETSAT–NOAA collaboration with European Commission funding and CNES expertise. Its radar altimeter would deliver data on about 90% of Earth's ocean, aiding forecasts, coastal planning, navigation, and pollutant tracking.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Fusarium graminearum is a common fungal plant pathogen.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Yunqing Jian, a 33-year-old Chinese plant scientist at the University of Michigan, pleaded guilty on November 12, 2025, to smuggling Fusarium graminearum into the US and making false statements to the FBI; she was sentenced to time served and expected to be deported. She had been arrested in June 2025. The case highlighted Fusarium graminearum, a common fungal pathogen that caused Fusarium head blight in cereals, cut yields up to 45%, cost farmers over $1 billion annually, and produced a harmful vomitoxin regulated by the FDA.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This does not meet the release conditions for a safe manned return.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">After 204 days in orbit, three astronauts returned to Earth aboard Shenzhou 21, leaving three crewmates aboard the Tiangong space station because the docked Shenzhou 20 return capsule had a cracked window glass suspected to have been struck by small space debris. Chinese officials postponed the original undocking, conducted image, simulation and wind-tunnel analyses, and declared Shenzhou 20 unsafe to carry crew; it remained in orbit for experiments. China said Shenzhou 22 would launch later.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““It’s up to 10 times faster than current delay-tolerant networking (DTN).””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland won 2025 R&amp;D 100 Awards for two developments, bringing its total to 130. Engineers led by Daniel Raible and Rachel Dudukovich developed High-Rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN), an open-source software protocol that enabled reliable, near-real-time, high-speed space-to-Earth data transfer, claimed up to ten times faster than current DTN and suitable for a solar system–wide internet. In partnership with the University of Pittsburgh and CorePower Magnetics, Glenn researchers co-invented VulcanAlloy, a nanocrystalline soft magnetic material operating above 500°C.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“New Glenn’s first stage booster successfully returned to Earth and landed on a barge at sea.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket successfully reached orbit for a second time on Nov. 13, 2025, carrying NASA’s twin ESCAPADE spacecraft to study Mars’s magnetic environment and atmosphere. The ESCAPADE pair were sent first to a Lagrange point until Mars was in better alignment for transfer. New Glenn’s first-stage booster returned and landed on a barge at sea for reuse, reducing launch costs. Wendy Whitman Cobb, affiliated with the US School of Advanced Air and Space Studies, called the flight positive for commercial space.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“On Earth, the formation of planar deformation features in quartz is only from the intense shockwaves generated by celestial body impacts.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers identified the Jinlin crater on a hillside in Guangdong Province near Zhaoqing as a Holocene impact structure. It measured 820–900 metres across and 90 metres deep and formed in the early to mid-Holocene. Thick weathered granite preserved the feature despite monsoon-driven erosion. Quartz showed planar deformation features formed at 10–35 gigapascals, confirming a hypervelocity meteorite impact (a comet would have produced a ≥10 km crater). The discovery challenged assumptions about recent impact frequency and preservation bias.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin launched its New Glenn rocket from Cape Canaveral, placing two identical NASA Mars orbiters, Escapade, into orbit for a later Earth gravity assist and arrival at Mars in 2027. The second New Glenn flight was delayed four days by weather and solar storms. Blue Origin recovered the booster on a barge 375 miles offshore, then the upper stage deployed the twin spacecraft, which would spend a year near Earth (~1 million miles) and study Mars’s upper atmosphere, magnetic fields and atmospheric escape.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““There’s a lot left up in the air, though the signs are more positive…””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA faced leadership uncertainty as Jared Isaacman—initially nominated, withdrawn amid a spat with Elon Musk, then renominated—competed with acting administrator Sean Duffy, who reportedly leaked a 62‑page Project Athena report. Isaacman received positive reviews at his first Senate hearing and a second was likely to confirm him, experts said. Project Athena proposed shifting missions to commercial partners, removing NASA from taxpayer‑funded climate science, questioning SLS and Gateway funding, and reviewing centers including JPL, risking congressional pushback.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Three hours and 36 minutes between launches is quite quick, but it's not a record;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched two Falcon 9 rockets from Florida's Space Coast less than four hours apart, each carrying 29 Starlink satellites. The first lifted from KSC Pad 39A at 10:08 p.m. EST; its first stage landed on drone ship A Shortfall of Gravitas and deployed its payload about 56 minutes after liftoff. The second launched from Cape Canaveral at 1:44 a.m. EST; its first stage landed on Just Read the Instructions and deployed about 65 minutes later. They were SpaceX's 145th and 146th Falcon 9 missions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Some ancient dogs show skull shapes that don’t match any living breed that we have studied.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers compared 643 canine skulls (158 modern dogs, 86 modern wolves, 391 archaeological spanning 50,000 years) using skeletal landmarks. They found Mesolithic and Neolithic dogs were about twice as morphologically diverse as Pleistocene canines and slightly over half as diverse as modern dogs, showing substantial size and shape variation long before formal breeds arose. Earliest skulls (12,700–50,000 years) remained wolf-like and were hard to distinguish by skull alone; formal breed concepts were recent.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that women under 50 who consumed higher amounts of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) had an increased risk of early-onset conventional adenomas, common bowel polyps that could precede cancer. The analysis used data from 29,105 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study II (women born 1947–1964) who completed food-frequency questionnaires from 1991 and underwent colonoscopy after 1991, excluding those with prior polyps, inflammatory bowel disease or cancer. The study appeared in JAMA Oncology.</p>

  <p class="dek">Since its discovery on 1 July 2025, ESA improved the predicted trajectory of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, by a factor of ten by using ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter observations from Mars taken 1–7 October. TGO observed the comet from about 29 million km at closest approach (3 October), roughly ten times closer than Earth telescopes; triangulation with Earth data reduced positional uncertainty, aided follow-up observations, and required precise accounting for the spacecraft’s Mars orbit. The comet posed no danger.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Our analysis shows that the solar system is moving more than three times faster than current models predict,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers reported that the solar system had been moving through space more than three times faster than previously theorized. They used LOFAR and two other radio telescopes to map radio-galaxy distributions and measured an anisotropy 3.7 times stronger than the standard cosmological model predicted. The finding agreed with earlier infrared quasar results, was published Nov. 10 in Physical Review Letters, and prompted questions about large-scale cosmic uniformity or galaxy distribution.</p>

  <p class="dek">Five volunteers who continued daily 40Hz light-and-sound (GENUS) stimulation for about two years were assessed; three female late-onset Alzheimer’s patients showed sustained cognitive measures above matched national controls and decreased plasma tau in two donors, while two male early-onset patients showed no significant benefit. The open-label extension followed an initial 2020 MIT trial of 15 mild-AD volunteers; researchers reported the method was safe, feasible, and may have slowed cognitive and biomarker progression.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This week’s geomagnetic storm events reached a Kp value of 9.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT Haystack Observatory scientists studied increased space weather that had driven unusual auroras visible in New England. They reported that coronal mass ejections and geomagnetic storms energized charged particles that excited upper‑atmosphere atoms and molecules, producing colored displays (red from lower‑energy oxygen above ~150 miles, green from higher‑energy oxygen below ~150 miles, rare purple/blue from molecular nitrogen ions). They noted Kp index thresholds (Kp≥6 favored lower‑latitude auroras) and said this week’s storms reached Kp=9. Haystack combined ground radars and satellite data; funding came from NSF and NASA.</p>

  <p class="dek">The Leonids were expected to peak the morning of Nov. 18 but were predicted to be weak in 2025, with long gaps likely. The shower originated from comet Tempel‑Tuttle (33 1/3‑year orbit), and heavy meteoroid concentrations lay near the comet rather than along Earth's 2025 path. Russian predictor Mikhail Maslov forecast about 15 meteors per hour from 18:00 UT Nov. 17 to 00:00 UT Nov. 18, favoring central/eastern Asia, and cautioned a 1699 trail might yield some brighter meteors 18–23 UT.</p>
