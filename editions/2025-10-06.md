  <blockquote class="quote">“Space is the ultimate high ground, critical for our national security.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Space Force assigned seven national-security launches; SpaceX was awarded five and ULA two. Space Systems Command paid SpaceX $714 million (about $143M per launch) and ULA $428 million ($214M per launch). ULA's Vulcan had debuted nearly two years earlier and flew its first national-security mission in August. The difference was partly ascribed to SpaceX's reusable boosters versus Vulcan's disposable design. Analysts noted ULA's per-launch prices had risen from about $112–$119M in prior awards; Blue Origin's New Glenn lacked final certification.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a shiny new layer just 80 nanometers thick”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Nightly dust and pollutants in Chile's Atacama Desert had settled on the Very Large Telescope's mirrors, degrading reflectivity, so technicians regularly recoated and polished the 25-ton mirror. They sometimes sprayed frozen carbon monoxide for light cleaning; eventually engineers removed the mirror, checked for particles, chemically stripped the old aluminum, and deposited a new 80-nanometer coating. The image was taken at the VLT basecamp at the foot of Cerro Paranal; the VLT had produced detailed observations from exoplanets to supermassive black-hole environs.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Endurance was &quot;in a brilliant state of preservation.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 1915 Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance became icebound in the Weddell Sea, endured months of compressive pack ice, and was ultimately crushed and sunk by cumulative compressive forces rather than a single event such as a torn rudder. Aalto University's Jukka Tuhkuri analyzed diaries, crew records and performed a novel structural analysis after the Endurance22 expedition (2022) found the well-preserved wreck. He concluded the ship had not been designed for those ice loads and that Shackleton likely understood the risk but sailed anyway.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“If we know the amount and scale of the limb darkening, then the data of a transit can be modified to account for it.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers had used transit photometry to find exoplanets, but tiny transit depths and stellar variability (flares, spots) increased size uncertainties. A study found that limb darkening—stars' edges appearing dimmer—biased transit-depth statistics because planets first crossed dimmer limbs. Accounting for limb darkening by modeling a star's atmosphere from its spectral type reduced uncertainty and could improve transit-depth accuracy by about fivefold. Limb darkening had been directly observed for only a few stars, so simulations were required.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Shalbatan Vallis, a 1300 km-long (~800 mi) outflow channel”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described ESA's Mars Express, which had studied Mars for more than twenty years as ESA's only operational mission, producing detailed atmospheric maps, Phobos studies, and mosaics used to create 3D landscape views. A newly released HRSC-based film flew over Xanthe Terra, highlighting Shalbatan Vallis, a 1,300 km outflow channel linking Southern Highlands to Northern Lowlands; many channels were believed to have fed water into a planet-wide ocean, and the tour ended with a view of the 100 km-wide Da Vinci crater.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ALIEN GIANT SHOCKS ASTRONOMERS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Duh! Like, of course there are planets out there!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Oct. 6, 1995, astronomers revealed 51 Pegasi b, the first exoplanet discovered around a Sun-like star. It was a Jupiter-like gas giant with an orbital period of just over four Earth days and a temperature near 1,000 °C. Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz found it with the ELODIE spectrograph on a 1.9‑m telescope by detecting the star’s Doppler wobble. The finding was a turning point and led to more than 6,000 known exoplanets, implying most of the Milky Way’s ~200 billion stars hosted planets.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;But absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article summarized Professor David Kipping's study which argued that red dwarf (M-dwarf) systems were unlikely to host observers like humans. It explained that, invoking the Copernican Principle and noting the Universe's age and the Sun's relative rarity, Kipping concluded that astrobiologists focusing on red-dwarf habitable planets might be looking in the wrong place. He led Columbia's Cool Worlds Laboratory and authored the paper titled &quot;Solar Hegemony: M-Dwarfs Are Unlikely to Host Observers Such as Ourselves,&quot; and he highlighted two unusual puzzles.</p>

  <p class="dek">October's full Harvest Moon rose above the eastern horizon on Oct. 6 and reached full phase at 11:48 p.m. EDT (0348 GMT Oct. 7). It was also the first supermoon of 2025, appearing subtly larger and brighter near Pisces with Saturn to its upper right. Viewers were advised to look east at sunset for a yellow‑orange moonrise; binoculars or a Celestron NexStar 4SE could reveal ejecta rays and Apollo landing sites (not hardware).

  <blockquote class="quote">“for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Mary E Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance. Announced by the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, the three shared 11m Swedish kronor. The prize recognised work on how T-cells were prevented from attacking the body; it noted that while harmful T-cells were known to be removed in the thymus, Sakaguchi had revealed a second mechanism involving CD25-expressing regulatory T-cells that eliminated self-reactive cells, preventing autoimmune disease.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">JUNO MAY BE DEAD; NASA CLOSED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“mission was extended to September of 2025.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA's Juno spacecraft may have powered down after its latest extension expired on Sept. 30, 2025, but agency officials could not confirm because a U.S. government shutdown had closed NASA. Launched in 2011 and orbiting Jupiter since 2016, Juno had exceeded its planned 20-month mission through multiple extensions (most recently in 2021) and had broadened goals to study Jupiter's rings and moons, conducting flybys of Ganymede, Europa and Io and mapping magnetic and gravity fields; its data aided Europa Clipper planning.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The colours on a butterfly’s wings are not trivial – they have been designed over millions of years.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that as tropical forests were replaced by simplified habitats such as eucalyptus plantations, butterflies became more muted. Bright wing colours had evolved in lush, diverse forests to aid mating, camouflage and survival, but degraded, warmer, drier plantations flooded with direct light favoured drab species. Roberto García‑Roa’s Brazilian project presented preliminary evidence within broader ‘discoloration’ research that habitat loss was leaching colour from ecosystems.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Glaciers are melting everywhere in the world.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Matthias Huss had first visited Rhône Glacier 35 years earlier when the ice lay a short walk from his parents' parking spot; by the time of reporting the ice was half an hour away. As director of GLAMOS he recalled how glaciers had looked in his childhood. Glaciers were retreating worldwide: in 2024 they had lost 450 billion tonnes outside Greenland and Antarctica, and Swiss glaciers had lost a quarter of their ice in the past decade.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the possibility of a storm”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">October marked the start of the autumn and winter meteor‑shower season and that week featured the Draconids. The shower was observer‑friendly and peaked in the early evening because its radiant was highest as darkness fell; peak was on 8 October at 20:00 BST for London. Under dark skies viewers usually saw about 10 slow, graceful meteors per hour. A waning moon reduced faint sightings, but comet 21P/Giacobini–Zinner had passed close to the Sun in March, raising the chance of a storm.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">HOLOGRAPHIC ULTRASOUND ENABLES MULTIPLE BRAIN TARGETS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The less intense the ultrasound, the safer this process is for the brain.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers developed a device that repurposed existing ultrasound technologies for neuromodulation and had reportedly been the first to target three to five distinct brain regions simultaneously. A team from ETH Zurich, the University of Zurich and New York University used hundreds of miniature transducers to create overlapping low-intensity pulses that formed focal points like a hologram in mice. The non-invasive method lowered activation thresholds and thermal risk; it had not yet been tested in humans and required further study of channel-protein interactions.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ROGUE PLANET ACCRETES AT RECORD RATE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An international team led by Víctor Almendros‑Abad observed rogue planet Cha 1107‑7626, 620 light‑years away in Chamaeleon, and found it was still forming. They estimated its mass at 5–10 Jupiter masses and detected an accretion disk; between April and August accretion surged eightfold to about six billion tonnes per second — the strongest episode recorded. Spectra (VLT X‑shooter, JWST NIRSpec/MIRI, VLT SINFONI) showed increased water vapor and implicated magnetic activity, suggesting star‑like formation. The study was published 29 August in Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI’s full potential.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">AMD partnered with OpenAI in a five-year agreement that committed OpenAI to purchase six gigawatts of AMD GPUs for its AI data centers, beginning with a one-gigawatt deployment of Instinct MI450 GPUs in the second half of 2026. AMD said the deal could deliver “tens of billions of dollars” and granted OpenAI the option to receive up to 160 million AMD shares; AMD shares rose 24% in pre-market trading.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“those types of dyes penetrate the body and tissue much better than light in the UV and visible range.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT chemists designed a new red to near-infrared fluorescent dye based on borenium ions, which had been too unstable for biomedical use. By attaching borenium ions to a ligand, they stabilized them and produced borenium-containing films, powders, and crystals that absorbed and emitted red/near-IR light. The work, published in Nature Chemistry, was led by Chun-Lin Deng with senior author Robert Gilliard and aimed to improve deeper tissue and tumor imaging compared with blue/green dyes.</p>
