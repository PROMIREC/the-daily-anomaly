  <h3 class="hed">EARTH'S COLLIDER CAME FROM NEARBY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The Moon-forming impactor Theia originated from the inner Solar System”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">According to the Giant Impact Hypothesis, a Mars-sized body named Theia collided with a proto‑Earth 4.5 billion years ago to form the Earth–Moon system. New MPS‑led research (Hopp et al., Science) analyzed iron‑isotope ratios in 15 terrestrial rocks and six lunar samples, compared with meteorites and other element isotopes (Cr, Mo, Zr). Mass‑balance calculations showed indistinguishable mass‑independent iron isotopic compositions for Earth and Moon, implying Theia had originated in the inner Solar System.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SILVER MOON COURTS GOLDEN SATURN</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The brilliant silver glow of the moon and the steady golden light of Saturn contrast beautifully.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Moon passed close to Saturn in the evening sky and was visible from urban locations though more striking with minimal light pollution. At 19:08 GMT on 29 November the Moon was directly north of Saturn and they were 3.75° apart. The Moon was nine days old (waxing gibbous, about 66% illuminated) in Pisces and Saturn shone faintly yellow in Aquarius. The pair were visible to the naked eye and fitted in binoculars but not most telescopes.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">UNIVERSE MAY HAVE NO EDGE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The observable limit was just that — a limit.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article argued that although the observable Universe was limited, we likely never knew its total size. Using the Earth’s finite but borderless curved surface as an analogy, it explained that a finite Universe could lack an edge via curvature. It noted a finite amount of information could ever be received, described geometric tests (triangle angles, parallel lines) and cited measured temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background as evidence used to probe cosmic geometry.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">WAYMO CLEARED FOR STATEWIDE DRIVERLESS SWEEP</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We're officially authorized to drive fully autonomously across more of the Golden State.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The California DMV approved Waymo’s request to conduct driverless testing and to deploy robotaxis across the whole Bay Area, Sacramento and most of Southern California up to the Mexico border. State maps showed expanded areas (lighter shading) beyond its prior zones. Waymo said it was authorized to drive fully autonomously across more of the state, named San Diego as its next California stop with rides by mid‑2026, and planned expansions to Las Vegas, Detroit and several 2026 U.S. cities.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““CO 2 is being used as an approximation for so many things””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Kawaiicon, New Zealand’s hacker conference, installed a room-by-room carbon dioxide monitoring system at the Michael Fowler Centre before November 6 to combat “con crud” amid measles, COVID‑19, influenza and RSV waves. Organizers deployed 13 DIY RGB Matrix Portal CO2 monitors adapted from Adafruit, published a public live dashboard with readings and history, and tested the devices with University of Otago public‑health researchers. They noted venue HVAC limits (MERV‑8 filters) and placed monitors across session rooms, kids’ areas, registration, green room and quiet room.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It is heart stopping. It is soul pounding. It is breathtaking.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA said astronauts were profoundly changed by the overview effect, a term Frank White coined in 1987. International Space Station crews used the cupola’s windows to view Earth, which many described as inspiring unity, altering concepts of home, prompting conservation, and motivating outreach and human expansion. Astronauts cited the “sea level effect,” personal perspective shifts, and emotionally powerful reactions, including tears in the cupola.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“These enhancements will immediately benefit customers already manifested on New Glenn to fly to destinations including low-Earth orbit, the Moon, and beyond.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin completed New Glenn’s second launch (NG‑2), deploying NASA’s ESCAPADE twin satellites to Mars and recovering the first stage, and announced structural, propulsion, avionics and reusability upgrades. It planned higher-performing BE‑4 and BE‑3U engines, a reusable fairing, lower-cost tank design and improved thermal protection, and a super‑heavy New Glenn 9x4 with an 8.7‑m fairing able to carry 70 t to LEO, 14 t to GSO and 20 t to TLI. It intended to fly both variants and support Artemis missions.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SATURN'S RINGS SEEM TO VANISH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“ring plane crossing”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Nov. 23 Saturn's rings appeared to have disappeared when viewed through a telescope because the rings aligned edge-on with Earth, an illusion astronomers called a &quot;ring plane crossing.&quot; Earth's and Saturn's orbital positions combined with Saturn's 26.7° tilt produced the effect. The previous crossing occurred on Mar. 23 but was lost in the Sun's glare. Observers saw Saturn in the southeastern sky in Pisces; a thin shadow across the planet and moons (Titan, Enceladus, Rhea) were detectable with a 4‑inch or larger telescope.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Observations of interstellar objects are still rare enough that we learn something new on every occasion.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Early October, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS passed within 30 million km of Mars and was seen by missions from multiple agencies; ESA and CNSA had already released images. After a U.S. government shutdown delay, NASA released images from MRO (HiRISE visible images on Oct. 2 at ≈0.2 AU that aided nucleus/size estimates), MAVEN (IUVS ultraviolet images Sept. 27–Oct. 7 revealing the coma and compositional limits), and Perseverance (Mastcam‑Z faint smudge on Oct. 4).</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We even know the gum chewer had brown eyes and hair.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Tartu’s Institute of History and Archaeology uncovered a 10,500‑year‑old piece of birch tar in Estonia bearing teeth impressions and saliva. Institute of Genomics analysis extracted DNA suggesting the chewer was a teenage girl with brown hair and brown eyes. The tar, made by distilling birch bark, had been used as an adhesive and to relieve toothache. Bettany Hughes said the institute held DNA samples from 20% of Estonia’s population; the discovery featured on her Channel 4 documentary.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Falcon 9 completes its 150th launch of 2025.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched 29 Starlink satellites from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral on Nov. 22 at 2:53 a.m. EST; the satellites deployed 1 hour 5 minutes later. SpaceX said the flight was Falcon 9's 150th launch of 2025 and the vehicle's 568th flight since 2010. First stage Booster B1080 landed on the droneship &quot;A Shortfall of Gravitas&quot; for its ninth recovery. The 29 satellites (Group 6-79) brought the constellation to more than 9,000 active units of over 10,400 launched since 2019, per Jonathan McDowell.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FRIAR ARGUES AGAINST CELESTIAL QUINTESSENCE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“ex quattuor elementis”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">During the 1240s Richard Fishacre, a Dominican friar and the first Dominican to teach theology at Oxford, used observations of light and color to argue that stars and planets were composed of the same four terrestrial elements rather than Aristotle's transparent &quot;fifth element&quot; or quintessence. He cited colored planetary light and the Moon's eclipses—arguing sunlight would pass through a transparent body—to conclude celestial bodies were composite, foreshadowing methods later used by the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SILENT ALGORITHMS STOKE PRICE HIKES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described how classic antitrust law, which banned explicit collusion between merchants, became complicated by sellers’ use of learning algorithms that automatically adjusted prices. A 2019 study had shown two identical learning algorithms could tacitly learn to retaliate—triggering threats and sustaining high prices. A recent paper by Aaron Roth and colleagues proved even apparently benign profit‑maximizing algorithms could produce high prices, complicating regulation because outcomes lacked explicit agreements or threats.</p>
