  <h3 class="hed">AI POISED TO POWER NUCLEAR ROCKETS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“AI is reshaping propulsion design and operations.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article said annual launches were set to grow and that propulsion was a critical challenge for Moon, Mars and beyond. It reported that AI, especially machine learning and reinforcement learning, had begun providing breakthroughs by optimizing nuclear thermal engines, managing plasma confinement for fusion, improving trajectories, and aiding design and real-time spacecraft operations, potentially enabling nuclear propulsion and more efficient propulsion systems.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AI INTUITS OBJECT PERMANENCE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““Their claims are, a priori, very plausible, and the results are super interesting.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at Meta developed V-JEPA, an AI model released in 2024 that learned physical intuitions from videos and exhibited a notion of “surprise” when observations contradicted its expectations. Building on Yann LeCun’s 2022 JEPA, V-JEPA avoided pixel-space limitations by masking video regions and predicting higher-level latent representations instead of individual pixels, allowing it to infer object permanence and scene dynamics without built-in physical assumptions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The space rocket launched without incident.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On November 27, a severe accident at Baikonur's Site 31/6 forced Russia to suspend launches to the ISS after an 8U216 mobile maintenance cabin was blown from its nook into the flame trench during Soyuz-MS28 launch. The launch itself succeeded and the crew reached the ISS safely. Inspections found damage to launch-pad components; causes included pressure differentials and possible failed locks. The cabin, a 130‑ton 1960s structure, needed replacement; repairs were estimated at months to up to three years, with parts available in Russia.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ROBOTAXIS FAIL TO STOP FOR BUSES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“our behavior should be better.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Waymo issued a voluntary software recall to prevent its robotaxi fleet from passing stopped school buses after an NHTSA investigation found some vehicles failed to stop for buses with flashing lights and stop signs in Atlanta and Austin. The company said it would file the recall with NHTSA and push a software update rather than pull vehicles. Waymo's chief safety officer acknowledged that &quot;our behavior should be better.&quot; Earlier recalls addressed gates, a telephone-pole crash and two robotaxis striking the same towed pickup.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">URANUS RADIATION MYSTERY MAY BE SOLVED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Science has come a long way since the Voyager 2 flyby.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SwRI researchers reanalyzed Voyager 2 data and proposed that the intense electron radiation belt Uranus showed in the 1986 flyby resulted from a transient solar wind structure (a co-rotating interaction region) that drove strong high-frequency waves which, as in a 2019 Earth event, could accelerate — not only scatter — electrons to high energies. Led by Dr. Robert C. Allen with Sarah Vines and George C. Ho, they published the study in Geophysical Research Letters and urged a dedicated Uranus mission.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ASTEROIDS FORGED PRIMITIVE SPACE GUM</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the sample was a polymer.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An OSIRIS‑REx sample from asteroid Bennu contained nitrogen‑ and oxygen‑rich polymeric sheets called “space gum.” Researchers reinforced the fragment with platinum, welded a microneedle and isolated it under an electron microscope, then analyzed it with microscopy and spectroscopy, confirming the sample was a polymer with amides. Authors proposed a “Cold‑First” origin: ammonium carbamate formed in &lt;−70°C ices and polymerized before later aqueous heating, leaving water‑resistant sheets preserved. The sample differed from Ryugu and meteorites and was evidence that life’s precursors could form on asteroids.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">JUPITER SHINES BESIDE WANING MOON</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Don't miss Jupiter shining close to the waning gibbous moon on the night of Dec. 7.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Jupiter shone close to an 83%-lit waning gibbous moon on the night of Dec. 7. The moon rose about three hours after sunset, with Jupiter less than five degrees to its upper right (roughly three middle-finger widths); both peaked early Dec. 8 near overhead in the southern sky near Castor and Pollux. The pair were naked-eye targets; a backyard telescope (≥4-inch) could reveal Jupiter’s cloud bands and Galilean moons, and lunar viewing showed Tycho Crater (about 108 million years old).</p>

  <h3 class="hed">PHANTOM RESONANCE HAUNTS CERN RING</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“In accelerator physics, an understanding of resonances and nonlinear dynamics is crucial for avoiding the loss of beam particles.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists at CERN and Goethe University Frankfurt isolated a resonant “ghost” in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) that affected particle behavior. The feature was a 3D shape that shifted over time, so it was best measured in 4D, and it arose from resonances that amplified energy and caused beam degradation. The nearly four-mile SPS (1970s vintage) had received a 2019 beam-dump upgrade; researchers mapped the resonance by measuring around the ring and built a Poincaré-section mathematical model.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MENSTRUAL CUP SURVIVES ROCKET RIDE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Now we can start implementing and redefine health autonomy in space.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists tested a menstrual cup on an uncrewed rocket flight in 2022. AstroCup placed two Lunette cups on a roughly nine-minute flight to 1.9 miles (3 km) to assess vibration and other stressors. Leak tests with glycerol and water found no damage or material degradation; the results were published in NPJ Women's Health. Authors concluded cups could be a reusable alternative to tampons in space but said more research was needed in reduced gravity and on longer missions, with plans to test products on the ISS.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FLIGHTS CAUSE TRIPLE AIR QUALITY DAMAGE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“you can have even more societal benefits if you figure out a smart way to structure your reductions”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers used a multifaceted modeling approach and data from three organizations to quantify air-quality impacts of purchasing renewable electricity versus reducing air travel. They found air travel caused about three times more air-quality damage than comparable electricity purchases. Impacts varied regionally because each action influenced pollution at different scales; high-altitude emissions from flights produced global effects. The study, led by Noelle Selin and Yuang (Albert) Chen, was published in Environmental Research Letters.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“SpaceX launched a new batch of its Starlink satellites today (Dec. 7).”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 from Vandenberg SLC-4E on Dec. 7 at 12:58 a.m. EST carrying 29 Starlink satellites (Group 11–15). Nine minutes later the second stage reached low Earth orbit, and after a coast and second burn the satellites were set to deploy an hour after liftoff. First stage B1088 completed its 12th flight and landed on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' droneship. Starlink surpassed 9,100 operational satellites; it was SpaceX's 115th Starlink launch and 157th Falcon 9 flight of the year.</p>
