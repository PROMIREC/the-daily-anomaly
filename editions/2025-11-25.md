  <h3 class="hed">WRITING REWIRES BRAINS, SPARKS RESILIENCE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“You don't need to carry this anymore.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Emily Johnston argued that ordinary writing changed the brain and helped people face everyday challenges by naming pain and creating distance, shifting states from overwhelm to clarity and reflecting resilience. She noted psychology, media and wellness framed resilience as an individual capacity; the APA defined it as ongoing growth. Based on research and student observation, she highlighted James Pennebaker’s 1980s expressive-writing method, which externalized distress, eased cognitive load and fostered safety.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">EXPERIMENTAL GENE THERAPY OFFERS HOPE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Things look really hopeful right now.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Three-year-old Oliver Chu from California became the first patient to receive a one-off experimental gene therapy for Hunter syndrome nine months earlier in a Manchester-run clinical trial. Doctors harvested his blood stem cells, corrected the faulty gene, reinfused them, and reported high enzyme production that reached his brain; Oliver stopped needing weekly Elaprase infusions. Clinicians said results were encouraging but preliminary, with four more boys scheduled and long-term benefits yet to be proven.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ROCKET RECRUITS: ONE IN 8,000</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Today is an exciting day for our nation and for all of humanity.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">When NASA’s 2025 astronaut candidates arrived at Johnson Space Center in fall 2025, they had been selected from more than 8,000 applicants and represented military test pilots, engineers, a physician, and a scientist. They would spend nearly two years in training before becoming eligible for missions to low Earth orbit, the Moon (Artemis), and eventually Mars. Upon graduation they would join NASA’s active astronaut corps to advance science aboard the ISS and support Artemis missions; the class was announced Sept. 22, 2025.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">CHINA SCRAMBLES UNCREWED RETURN CRAFT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;unprecedented rescue mission&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">China launched an uncrewed Shenzhou 22 aboard a Long March 2F/G rocket from Jiuquan on Nov. 24 (0411 GMT) to dock with the Tiangong space station and provide a return vehicle for three astronauts aboard Shenzhou 21. Their original reentry craft (Shenzhou 20) had been declared unsafe after a window crack from a suspected debris impact. Shenzhou 22 was due to dock about 4.5 hours after launch; Shenzhou 23 was expected in April 2026.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">RESEARCHERS PROPOSE BIG HEADED HUMAN SPECIES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“big head”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Anthropologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Hawai’i proposed a new hominin species, Homo juluensis, in Nature Communications and PaleoAnthropology. They said H. juluensis lived in eastern Asia from about 300,000 to 50,000 years ago, hunted wild horses, made stone tools, and processed hides. Using a new fossil-classification system, researchers argued that fossils including Penghu 1, Xiahe, Xuchang and Denisova specimens represented this 'big head' species, though they said further research was required.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AMAZON UNLEASHES AI BUG HUNTERS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“hallucinations are architecturally impossible.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Amazon published details of Autonomous Threat Analysis (ATA), an internal system it had used to help security teams proactively identify weaknesses, perform variant analysis, and develop remediations and detection capabilities. ATA, born from an August 2024 hackathon, combined multiple specialized AI agents that competed as red and blue teams inside high‑fidelity test environments that produced real telemetry and verifiable logs. The design enforced evidence‑based validation, reduced false positives, and enabled rapid, scalable defenses.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STOPPING MOUNJARO TRIGGERS HEALTH REVERSAL</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the findings are not a surprise”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers analysing Surmount-4 trial data reported that people who stopped using the tirzepatide injection Mounjaro regained weight and lost other health benefits, including improvements in blood pressure and ‘bad’ cholesterol. The trial involved people with obesity or overweight and at least one weight-related health problem; study authors included experts from Eli Lilly. Independent cardiometabolic professor Naveed Sattar said the findings were unsurprising and that stopping such drugs could remove protective effects against heart failure and death.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">PRELAUNCH ROMAN TELESCOPE STUNS ASTRONOMERS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“With asteroseismic data we'll be able to get a lot of information about exoplanets' host stars.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Once launched in the next 12 to 18 months, NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope was expected to exceed initial expectations: it had a 2.4‑m (8‑ft) mirror like Hubble but a field of view 100 times larger, and its Galactic Bulge Time‑Domain Survey would monitor millions of bulge stars every 12 minutes over six 70.5‑day campaigns. Researchers found Roman could measure seismic oscillations in more than 300,000 red giants via asteroseismology, informing stellar masses, sizes, ages and exoplanet studies.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Their photographs of Earth record how the planet changes over time due to human activity and natural events.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui captured a photo of southern Europe and the northwestern Mediterranean coast from the International Space Station 261 miles above Earth on Aug. 30, 2025. At left, the Po Valley urban corridor, including Milan, Turin and suburbs, was visible. Crew Earth Observations had produced hundreds of thousands of images of Earth that recorded changes from human activity and natural events, enabling scientists to monitor disasters, direct responses on the ground, and study phenomena such as glacier movement and urban wildlife.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MINIMAL CELL DEFIES LIFE DEFINITIONS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Metabolism is one of the key components of how we often define life.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers published a May preprint reporting a newly discovered single-celled organism with an exceptionally reduced genome that lacked metabolic genes, preventing independent nutrient processing or growth and appearing to be an obligate parasite dependent on host cells or communities. Its genome retained a replicative core comprising over half the genome. Authors said the finding challenged conventional definitions of life and implied such interdependent minimal microbes might be widespread.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“They’re forming later in the season and breaking up earlier.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA and NOAA reported the 2025 Antarctic ozone hole was the fifth smallest since 1992, with an average extent of about 7.23 million sq mi (18.71 million sq km) from Sept. 7–Oct. 13 and a one-day peak of 8.83 million sq mi on Sept. 9. It broke up nearly three weeks earlier than in the past decade, was about 30% smaller than 2006’s largest, and agencies said Montreal Protocol controls were driving gradual recovery toward full recovery later this century.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">RESEARCHERS CLAIM BRAIN SEES TOMORROW</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Precognition is a form of intuition that can only be explained by getting information from the future.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Popular Mechanics’ episode featured Elizabeth Rayne interviewing Julia Mossbridge, PhD, about precognition. Mossbridge defined precognition as intuition not based on memory, causation, or inference, arguing it required information from the future. She described experiments that used truly random number generators to select targets and proposed two forms of precognition, suggesting the brain might carry an &quot;echo of the future&quot; analogous to ripples from a pebble.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">WOLF BLOOD LURKS IN DOGS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Domestication happened twice, in eastern and western Eurasia.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article stated that dogs had been the first domesticated species, had evolved from gray wolves, and had provided many human benefits. Scientists had debated where, when and how often dogs were domesticated; ancient DNA indicated domestication had happened twice, in eastern and western Eurasia, and those groups later mixed to form the ancestors of all modern dogs. Molecular-clock analyses dated domestication to about 20,000–22,000 years ago, and the earliest archaeological dog was a 14,000-year-old pup from Bonn-Oberkassel. The authors reexamined the rarity of dog–wolf hybridization.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AI HINTS NUCLEAR ROCKET REVIVAL</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“propulsion – the methods used to push rockets and spacecraft forward.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Authors from the University of North Dakota (an assistant professor of space studies, a master’s student, a Ph.D. student and a research assistant professor of aviation) disclosed funding and potential conflicts. They reported that hundreds of rockets were launched each year, that that number was expected to grow with Moon and Mars missions, and that propulsion — the methods used to push rockets and spacecraft forward — was a critical challenge.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MARTIAN CAVES MAY HARBOR LIFE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;in situ exploration of Martian karstic caves is an achievable goal&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists led by Chunyu Ding identified possible karstic caves in Hebrus Valles on Mars, revealed by eight skylights tens to over 100 meters across. Using TES, Odyssey gamma-ray hydrogen data and HiRISE terrain models, they found carbonate- and sulfate-rich sediments laid down over 3.5 billion years ago and evidence for subsurface ice. They proposed slightly acidic groundwater later dissolved the bedrock to form caves and skylights, with local heating melting ice; not all regions could form such karst.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BUBBLE PUZZLE ANSWER REVEALED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“What is the road system that connects all four towns using the smallest total length of road?”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Today’s puzzle asked which road network connected four towns at the corners of a square with the smallest total road length. It presented and rejected several alternatives—the O-loop and U-route as needlessly excessive and the X-road as the shortest link between opposite towns but not optimal overall. The puzzle invoked soapy water and included an UPDATE directing readers to the solution.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DARPA UNLEASHES SPACE EYE NETWORK</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;The goal of the TBD2 program is to enable continuous space-based detection and tracking of objects in cislunar space on relevant timelines,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">DARPA launched the TBD2 initiative to detect and track extremely faint objects in cislunar space by pairing commercial optical sensors, advanced signal-processing algorithms, and a spacecraft positioned near the Sun–Earth Lagrange Point 1 (~930,000 miles). The program sought continuous space-based surveillance capable of detecting roughly 1‑meter objects at ~2 gigameters with under 12‑hour revisits, using a computationally intensive track-before-detect approach to overcome ground-based telescope limitations.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SENATE RUSHES TO COUNTER CHINA</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;As China and other countries expand their space programs, the United States can't afford to lose ground.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A bipartisan group of senators proposed creating a National Institute for Space Research to coordinate U.S. research on commercial stations after the ISS retired in 2030, contingent on passage of the Space RACE Act. Sponsors, including former astronaut Mark Kelly, argued the institute was needed to prevent China’s Tiangong from capturing multinational research, citing increased Chinese activity and cyber/surveillance concerns. The proposal followed earlier hearings and coincided with proposed NASA budget cuts that critics said could weaken U.S. space competitiveness.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we have never successfully created propellant on the Moon.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article said in-situ propellant reduced launch mass but Donald Rapp argued lunar ISRU might not be worth developing while Mars was more promising. It noted VIPER's cancellation and that two lunar methods—carbothermal reduction and polar-ice mining—faced severe logistical, power and de-risking challenges: carbothermal required methane shipped from Earth, 1650°C heating and a 14-step autonomous processing chain; polar ice’s physical state and PSR darkness were unknown. MOXIE had already produced oxygen from Mars’ atmosphere, making scaling simpler.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AI SAVES GRID, STRAINS POWER</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“That's exactly where AI can come into the picture.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article said that while AI-driven data centers could stress electricity grids and slow the clean-energy transition, AI was also reducing energy use and emissions in buildings, transport and industry; optimizing siting and design of wind, solar and storage; improving grid operations, efficiency, renewables integration, equipment-failure prediction and investment planning; and accelerating materials discovery for reactors, batteries and electrolyzers. MIT launched a Data Center Power Forum. AI was described as enabling real-time forecasting and control to balance intermittent supply and demand and maintain grid parameters.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It's a tiny, tiny little effect, but statistically it’s quite real.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Popular Mechanics featured an episode in which Elizabeth Rayne explored precognition with Dean Radin, a parapsychologist and chief scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. Radin described surveys of reported experiences and precognitive dreams (about half of audiences reported such dreams) and described forced-choice quantum-light experiments. He said meta-analyses across many trials had found a very small but statistically significant effect and discussed the multidirectional nature of time.</p>

  <p class="dek">NASA HEAT and My NASA Data released classroom resources that invited students and educators to engage with real NASA mission data to study space weather in real time. Materials drew from Parker Solar Probe, SDO, and Solar Orbiter data and aimed to increase understanding of the Sun’s influence on Earth, including auroras, radio disruptions, satellite interference, and power-grid impacts. The launch coincided with the late-2024 solar maximum, offering data-driven opportunities for classroom observation and study.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It was already known that emerald-green decays over time, but we wanted to understand exactly the role of light and humidity in this degradation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers investigated why 19th-century synthetic emerald-green pigments, used by Cézanne, Munch, van Gogh and Monet, often degraded—forming cracks, dark copper oxides and releasing arsenic—by testing the roles of light and humidity. They sampled microscopically from James Ensor’s The Intrigue (1890), analyzed historical and commercial pigments and Munch paint tubes, and created linseed-oil mockups. Analyses included Fourier-transform infrared imaging and synchrotron radiation X-ray methods. The study was reported in Science Advances.</p>
