  <blockquote class="quote">“We are much more certain than last year that this is definitely a thing.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 2025, Quanta reviewed physics advances: physicists reported a potentially paradigm‑shifting new black hole, stronger evidence that dark energy had weakened over time from larger DESI and Dark Energy Survey maps (DESI increased to 15 million galaxies), and discoveries that Earth's deep interior was more connected, reshaping understanding of the planet’s engine. A centennial Helgoland conference exposed heated debate over quantum interpretations (Quanta’s Charlie Wood recounted seasickness aboard the conference ferry). DESI cautioned the results were not yet definitive; the Vera C. Rubin Observatory began operations to settle the question.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It suggests that imagination is not passive. Rather, it can actively shape what we expect and what we choose.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">It reported a Nature Communications study from the University of Colorado Boulder and the Max Planck Institute that found vividly imagining positive or negative interactions produced measurable neural and behavioral changes. In an fMRI experiment, fifty subjects imagined eight-second scenarios with neutral acquaintances; later they preferred people imagined in positive scenarios. Researchers linked surprisingly positive “prediction error” to ventral striatum activation and also saw dorsomedial prefrontal cortex engagement, suggesting imagination shaped memory and had implications for therapy and mental health.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We just witnessed the collision of two planetesimals...&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers imaged, in 2004 and 2023, the first direct collisions between large objects in a planetary system beyond the solar system, in the young Fomalhaut system 25 light-years away and about 440 million years old. They observed dust clouds from impacts of ~60-km bodies (at least four times the Chicxulub impactor), reinterpreted Fomalhaut b as a collision-generated dust cloud, estimated ~300 million similar planetesimals in the disk, and noted CO gas indicated volatile-rich, comet-like bodies.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“venting of the propulsion tank”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX lost control of Starlink 35956 after an anomaly caused a sudden altitude drop and a debris field. Loss of communications, the drop, venting of the propulsion tank and release of trackable low-velocity objects suggested an explosion. SpaceX said it posed no threat to the ISS crew and would burn up within weeks. Leo Labs judged an internal energetic source, not a collision; radar detected tens of objects at 418 km in a crowded low Earth orbit with over 24,000 tracked objects.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">PERSEVERANCE FACES 100KM TRIAL</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Perseverance is really in excellent shape.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA had expected a Mars sample‑retrieval lander by 2026–2028, but the original MSR plan’s projected cost rose to $11 billion and no lander was built; launch was unlikely until the 2030s. Perseverance was in excellent health nearly five years after landing, had driven about 25 miles (40 km) — twice its mobility certification — and used a plutonium power source. JPL judged the rover operable at least to 2031; the arm and wheels were seen as likely lifetime limits and tests targeted 100 km driving.</p>

  <p class="dek">Science Corporation, founded in 2021 by former Neuralink president Max Hodak, launched a division to extend organ life by improving perfusion systems. The Alameda startup, previously focused on neural interfaces and a retinal implant acquired from Pixium Vision, aimed to build smaller, portable systems to replace costly ECMO and organ-care machines. Its team kept rabbit kidneys viable for up to 48 hours and planned to reach one month by next spring. Science had raised about $290 million.</p>

  <p class="dek">The article reported that NASA and ScienceAlert identified a human-made space-weather belt caused by decades of very low frequency (VLF) radio transmissions. Probes first detected a related phenomenon in 2012, and by 2017 NASA published findings showing that VLF waves produced on Earth canceled and repelled parts of the Van Allen radiation belts. The piece also explained VLF usage (notably by the military) and frequency allocation issues.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“protoplanetary discs”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Gaia had provided a unique peek into dusty protoplanetary environments by presenting a collage of 31 baby star systems. ALMA images showed the systems and a scale bar in AU, plus a predicted 1‑million‑year view of the Solar System for reference. The systems centered on very young stars formed from collapsing gas and dust that flattened into protoplanetary discs; remaining material was expected to clump into planets, though dust had made such planets hard to detect.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers at MIT and the Broad Institute found a way to temporarily program liver cells using mRNA delivering three key factors to compensate for age-related thymic decline and improve T cell function. In mice, treated aged animals developed larger, more diverse T cell populations after vaccination and showed improved responses to cancer immunotherapy. The work, led by Mirco Friedrich with senior author Feng Zhang, appeared in Nature. The thymus was described as normally guiding T cell development and secreting survival cytokines.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“China wants the United States 100 percent kicked out of its supply chains.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Reuters reported that scientists in Shenzhen had completed a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine earlier in the year and were testing it. The device was reportedly built by former ASML engineers and could generate EUV light though it was not yet producing chips. Reuters said China aimed for domestic EUV chip production by 2028 (others projected 2030). The report noted EUV's complexity and Xi Jinping's push for independent semiconductor supply chains.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Watermarked text looks like ordinary text, but the markers are embedded in subtle ways that do not reveal themselves to casual inspection.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">People and institutions were grappling with AI-written text because enforcing rules required reliably detecting AI generation. Studies found heavy AI-tool users and evaluation panels could sometimes outperform automated detectors, but expertise was uncommon. Automated detectors produced probabilistic scores, yet their reliability depended on knowing plausible AI tools, access to them, text quantity, and whether generators had embedded watermarks. Detection strategies included learned classifiers trained on labeled corpora and model-based statistical checks such as unusually high model-assigned probabilities for exact wording.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“You want it to be really runny.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In late November in Devon, workers mixed a mineral fluid 2.5 times denser than water for a RheEnergise pumped-hydro demonstrator. The fluid flowed between reservoirs 80 meters apart to drive turbines and was pumped back up to store energy. RheEnergise said the denser fluid cut volume and elevation needs, expanding viable UK sites from a few dozen to thousands, and generated first power that week with a possible 10 MW project by 2028. Industry groups reported a global pumped-hydro boom, citing large projects including Fengning.</p>

  <p class="dek">NASA and Boeing tested a higher-aspect-ratio (longer, thinner) wing model in wind tunnels as part of their Integrated Adaptive Wing Technology Maturation collaboration to seek efficiency gains while managing flexibility-related issues. They investigated gust loads, maneuver loads, and wing flutter—which could amplify oscillations and cause catastrophic failure—and worked to soften gust impacts, lessen wing loads during turns, and suppress flutter to improve performance, fuel efficiency, and passenger comfort.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Today, Europe is more resilient than it was yesterday.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On 17 December two Galileo satellites, SAT 33 and SAT 34, launched from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana aboard Ariane 6 — Galileo’s first Ariane 6 launch and the rocket’s fifth flight. They separated after just under four hours and the launch was declared successful; both satellites were healthy with solar arrays deployed. They entered early operations to join Galileo in medium Earth orbit (~23,222 km). In about three months the constellation would have 29 active satellites and two further first-generation launches were planned.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the absence of gravity’s physical forces allows scientists to grow larger, more uniform, and higher-quality crystals”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA opened the International Space Station to industry research and had devoted half the crew’s time to these aims. ISS National Lab research supported Merck’s development of a subcutaneous formulation of pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA), which the FDA approved in September. Since 2014 Merck had flown crystal-growth experiments aboard the station; microgravity produced larger, more uniform monoclonal-antibody crystals and crystalline suspensions that dissolved easily, enabling a one-minute subcutaneous dose every three weeks versus prior infusions up to two hours, reducing time and cost.</p>

An ASU-led study with collaborators argued that SETI was constrained by anthropocentric bias and noted Project Ozma and Earth's declining radio loudness made radio searches narrow. The paper, under review at PNAS Nexus, recommended broader theoretical frameworks, inclusion of non-human communication methods, and searches for alternative technosignatures (lasers, neutrinos, gravitational waves).</p>

Scientists inferred the events destroyed ~60 km (37-mile) planetesimals and estimated about 300 million similar bodies in the system. Two collisions seen within ~20 years contradicted prior collision-rate estimates and suggested implications for planet-formation studies and future exoplanet imaging.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers at MIT CSAIL showed that a brief period of alignment called guidance, in which a target network was encouraged to match a guide network’s internal representations, dramatically improved performance of architectures long considered untrainable. In experiments with deep fully connected networks, short practice with a guide using random noise led to greater stability, lower training loss, and avoided overfitting. Guidance differed from distillation by transferring structural biases even from untrained networks and helped separate architectural bias from learned knowledge.</p>

The discovery, reported by Rinaldi et al. in The Astrophysical Journal, showed how JWST’s infrared capability challenged theories of early galaxy and SMBH formation and probed the fate of early LRDs.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It’s definitely not just an exploding star.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) were likely due to large black holes shredding massive companion stars. New research by Natalie LeBaron et al., submitted to The Astrophysical Journal and available on arXiv, analyzed the brightest known LFBOT, AT 2024wpp — ten times more luminous than the next brightest — and evaluated alternatives (supernovae, failed supernovae forming black holes, magnetars, and tidal disruption events). LeBaron stated it was not just an exploding star.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we saw molecular carbon.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope identified an exoplanet, PSR J2322-2650b, orbiting a pulsar in a black-widow system. Its close orbit and the pulsar’s gravity had distorted it into an oblong, lemon-like shape. Spectra showed an atmosphere dominated by helium and carbon, with molecular carbon instead of expected molecules like water or methane, and researchers said existing formation mechanisms could not readily explain its carbon-rich composition.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STAR STRIKES TWICE; ASTRONOMERS BAFFLED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“At first, for about three days, the eruption looked just like the first kilonova in 2017.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported a possible 'superkilonova' — a supernova followed hours later by a kilonova — from AT2025ulz on 18 August 2025, first detected by LIGO. Early observations matched the 2017 kilonova (red, heavy-element signatures), but days later the emission brightened, turned blue and showed hydrogen consistent with a supernova. The team proposed the progenitor supernova produced two neutron-star cores that subsequently collided, producing the double explosion.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The launch went perfectly, and the DiskSat dispenser worked exactly as designed.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Four DiskSats rode a Rocket Lab Electron from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility into orbit, deploying about an hour after liftoff at roughly 340 miles. The Aerospace Corporation designed the 1 m-wide, 1-inch-thick carbon-fiber disk-shaped satellites, which were funded by NASA (development) and the U.S. Space Force (launch) and were intended to demonstrate a lightweight rideshare-optimized platform that carried solar cells, avionics, reaction wheels and an electric thruster. Engineers established contact with all four; the concept traced to Rich Welle via Aerospace’s xLab.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Valle de la Luna’s neighboring block was covered with polygons.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Curiosity drove from the “Nevado Sajama” drill site back into the Monte Grande boxwork hollow to study another bedrock block and map a hollow-to-ridge transect. Post-drive images revealed that the block adjacent to Valle de la Luna was covered with polygons. The team planned a super-sized MAHLI mosaic for 3D modeling, APXS and ChemCam LIBS measurements on polygon centers, ridges and a scuffed patch, Mastcam stereo of the hollow wall, and a MARDI sidewalk during the Sol 4748 drive.</p>
