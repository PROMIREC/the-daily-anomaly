  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;The extra 12 months in space does add some additional wear-and-tear to the spacecraft.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA's twin ESCAPADE probes launched and were placed into a loiter orbit around Earth's L2 because Earth and Mars were not aligned for a direct transfer. They were tasked with studying how solar wind drove Martian atmospheric escape. In 2026 they used an Earth gravity assist for trans‑Mars injection and reached Mars for orbit insertion in Sept. 2027. Teams said the year added wear but switching to chemical propulsion and larger tanks avoided a 2.1‑year wait and supported the mission through May 2029.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Deployment of 29 Starlink satellites confirmed.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Jan. 4, 2026, SpaceX launched the first Starlink satellites of 2026 on a new Falcon 9, lifting off at 1:48 a.m. EST from Cape Canaveral. The rocket carried 29 Starlink Group 6-88 satellites, reached low Earth orbit about nine minutes after liftoff and deployed them about an hour later. The first stage landed on the droneship Just Read the Instructions. SpaceX said Starlink approached 9,500 active satellites and was providing free broadband to Venezuela through Feb. 3. It was SpaceX’s second launch of 2026.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">GOVERNMENTS RACE FOR LOWER ORBITS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The images from very low Earth orbit satellites are sharper”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">About 15,000 satellites orbited Earth, most in low Earth orbit (LEO) up to about 1,200 miles (2,000 km), and growing launches — including SpaceX’s Starlink — had crowded LEO. The article said very low Earth orbit (VLEO), 60–250 miles (100–400 km) altitude, was closer and could alleviate crowding while offering sharper images, lower-latency communications and improved atmospheric and weather observations for agriculture, climate science, disaster response and surveillance. Governments and industry worked to develop VLEO; the author disclosed ties to Victoria Defense.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SUPERNOVA COULD SPAWN EARTHS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Cosmic-ray bath in a past supernova gives birth to Earth-like planets.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Article said making Earth-like planets required sufficient mass, an atmosphere and magnetic field, the right orbital distance, and an abundance of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs, half-lives &lt;5 Myr). SLR decay had warmed the early solar system and prevented terrestrial planets from becoming water-rich Hycean worlds; meteorite isotope excesses (e.g., Al-26 → Mg-26) recorded that. Sawada et al. proposed a distant supernova’s cosmic-ray bath (within ~1 parsec) could have supplied SLRs without destroying the protoplanetary disk, which implied terrestrial planets were common.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">XRISM REVEALS RAPIDLY SPINNING BLACK HOLE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Astrophysical black holes have only two properties: mass and spin.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">XRISM, a JAXA–NASA mission launched on Sept. 7, 2023, combined Resolve’s high spectral resolution with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR to record the sharpest X-ray spectrum of Seyfert galaxy MCG–6-30-15 (120.7 million light-years). The team isolated a broad, warped iron emission line and associated reflection from an accretion disk near a ~2 million-solar-mass SMBH, evidence of rapid spin and matter orbiting close to the event horizon. They also characterized the SMBH’s corona and identified at least five accretion-driven wind zones.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">HEAT TRAP UNLEASHES VIOLENT STORMS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Our analysis shows that the eastern and midwestern regions of U.S. and the eastern Asian regions may be new hotspots for humid heat in the future climate.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT scientists reported in Science Advances that a region’s maximum humid heat and storm intensity were limited by the strength of atmospheric inversions. Inversions trapped and built up surface heat and moisture in midlatitude regions, producing longer, more oppressive humid heat waves; when inversions weakened the stored energy was released as convection, fueling intense thunderstorms and heavy rainfall. The team said climate warming could make inversions more persistent, raising humid-heat and storm risk in midlatitudes (eastern/midwestern U.S., eastern Asia).</p>

  <h3 class="hed">GRAVITATIONAL WAVES MAP DARK MATTER</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“first fully relativistic framework for predicting GWs”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Gravitational waves, discovered in 2015, were used in a University of Amsterdam study to probe dark matter. UvA/GRAPPA researchers (Rodrigo Vicente, Theophanes K. Karydas, Gianfranco Bertone) published in Physical Review Letters a fully relativistic model for how black-hole binaries and EMRIs were affected by their environments, replacing prior Newtonian approximations. They showed dense dark-matter spikes or mounds would leave discernible imprints on GW signals and predicted LISA and ground detectors could detect such signatures to map dark-matter distribution and nature.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SKY MENACE: FALLING SPACE JUNK</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Aircraft can be affected by much smaller pieces of debris.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Space debris fell back into Earth's atmosphere about once a week on average, mostly empty rocket stages and dead satellites; most objects burned up, but fragments—from dust to propellant tanks—survived and could strike aircraft. Experts warned the small but rising risk included a 26% chance that debris would traverse busy airspace within a year (UBC, early 2025) and an estimated 1-in-1,000 chance per flight by 2030; they cited the 2022 Long March 5B re-entry as an example.</p>
