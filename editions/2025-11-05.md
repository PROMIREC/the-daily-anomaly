  <h3 class="hed">TWISTING SOLAR WAVES HINT CORONAL HEAT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This discovery ends a protracted search for these waves that has its origins in the 1940s.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists using the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii observed small-scale torsional Alfvén waves in the sun's corona, marking the first direct evidence of tiny twisting magnetic motions. During commissioning in October 2023 they detected red and blue Doppler shifts in iron atoms heated to 1.6 million °C on opposite sides of magnetic loops, revealing corkscrew-like twists. The finding supported models that such waves transported and dissipated energy, helping heat the corona and power the solar wind.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Knockdown Activity and Target Models from Additive regression Predictions”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers published an open-access Nature Biotechnology paper presenting KATMAP (Knockdown Activity and Target Models from Additive regression Predictions), a framework that used perturbation RNA-seq data (overexpression/knockdown) plus splicing-factor binding-sequence information to model and predict splicing-factor regulatory targets, distinguish direct from indirect effects, and interpret regulation across cell types and species. They showed KATMAP could predict whether synthetic nucleic acids affected splicing and highlighted relevance for diseases caused by splicing mutations.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SUPER-GROWTH BURST STUNS, THEN STOPS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“super-Eddington growth didn't help much in the long run.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article reported that JWST had found billion-solar-mass black holes when the Universe was about 0.5 billion years old, which were too massive to be explained by mergers or by standard Eddington-limited accretion. Hydrodynamic simulations of the cosmic dark age found a transient super-Eddington phase that grew black holes up to ~10,000 solar masses, but feedback reinstated the Eddington limit and long-term masses converged, so super-Eddington growth could not explain the early giants and very early large seeds were suggested.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This is a long continuity of behaviour.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Namorotukunan site in northwest Kenya showed that primitive humans living 2.75 million years ago used Oldowan stone tools continuously for about 300,000 years. Ten years of excavation recovered 1,300 sharp flakes, hammerstones and cores in three stratified layers, implying the technology was learned and transmitted across thousands of generations. The research was led by Prof David Braun and published in Nature Communications; team members reported skilled selection of quality riverbed stones and notable technical continuity.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AI REVEALS SUPER-RECOGNISERS' SECRETS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““It’s not just about looking everywhere – it’s about looking smart.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers used eye-tracking data from a prior study of 37 super-recognisers and 68 typical recognisers to reconstruct the retinal information participants saw when viewing full or partially revealed faces. They fed that input into deep neural networks trained for face recognition and compared it to full-face images (same or different), producing similarity scores. The work, by Dr James Dunn (UNSW) in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, related to why super-recognisers—used in cases from Salisbury to murder and sexual predator investigations—excelled.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““The Shenzhou-20 crewed spacecraft is suspected to have been struck by a small piece of orbital debris.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The planned return of three Shenzhou-20 astronauts to Earth was delayed after their spacecraft was suspected to have been struck by a small piece of orbital debris, Chinese state media reported. The crew had flown to the Tiangong station in April and had been due to return on 5 November after six months; their replacements on Shenzhou-21 had already arrived. The China Manned Space Agency said assessments were under way and the return was postponed; backups Shenzhou-22 and a Long March 2F launcher were on standby. Authorities did not say when the impact occurred; the crews had conducted a handover and shared a meal.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">RADIO ASTRONOMY SPARKS SOVIET HUNT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Gabriela Radulescu received fellowships and funding. As humans explored space in the late 20th century, radio waves were used to communicate with spacecraft and were received by radio telescopes, which sometimes picked up artificial telecommunications. That interference threatened observations and inspired a Cold War–era field combining radio astronomy and radio communications to search for artificial radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. That effort became known as the search for extraterrestrial intelligence; in the 1960s only the US and USSR had capability.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;The pixels were saturated, so it's possible the flash was even brighter than the recorded data suggests&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Japanese astronomer Daichi Fujii recorded two lunar impact flashes on Oct. 30 and Nov. 1, captured with cameras on the moon's nightside and shared on X. The Oct. 30 flash occurred east of Gassendi and was likely a Taurid meteoroid; it struck at 27 km/s at a 35° angle, had an estimated mass of 0.2 kg, excavated a 3 m crater and produced a 0.1 s flash. The Nov. 1 flash appeared west of Oceanus Procellarum. Fujii had logged about 60 flashes since 2011.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This training goes beyond engineering.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">From 7 to 10 October 2025, ESA and the African Space Agency (AfSA) co‑implemented a Space Systems Engineering Training Course at ESEC‑Galaxia, Belgium, under the Africa‑EU Space Partnership Programme (AESPP) funded by the European Commission’s Global Gateway. Thirty students from 24 nationalities (13 from Africa) received instruction on requirements engineering, mission architecture, budgeting and risk management, including a time‑and‑risk simulation. The course aimed to build technical capacity, foster Europe–Africa cooperation and continued joint AESPP training and technology‑transfer activities.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;If dark matter is not subject to a fifth force, then galaxies — which are mostly made of dark matter — will fall into these wells like ordinary matter, governed only by gravity.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers compared galaxy velocities with the depths of cosmic gravity wells using up-to-date cosmological data and found that dark matter fell into those wells like ordinary matter, consistent with general relativity on large scales. The UNIGE-led team reported no evidence for a fifth fundamental force acting on dark matter but constrained any such force to be no stronger than 7% of gravity.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STINKBUGS' LEGS BEAR MOBILE FUNGAL FARMS</h3>
  
  <p class="dek">Researchers had long assumed female Dinidoridae stinkbugs possessed hind-leg tympanal organs for hearing; Japanese scientists examined Megymenum gracilicorne and discovered those structures were not auditory organs but mobile fungal nurseries of a previously unseen kind. Dinidoridae, a small Asian stinkbug family studied mainly taxonomically and morphologically, had received less attention than larger relatives such as Pentatomidae.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ROGUE GEOENGINEERING COULD WREAK HAVOC</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This is not a question of whether [solar geoengineering] is safe.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Royal Society review warned solar geoengineering, if deployed regionally by rogue actors, could increase North Atlantic hurricane intensity, trigger Amazon dieback and cause African drought, whereas globally coordinated, long-term deployment would likely lower temperatures. Researchers said geoengineering masked symptoms but did not cut emissions, risked a 1–2°C 'termination shock' if halted abruptly, cost billions annually versus trillions for climate action, divided scientists, and examined stratospheric SO2 injection.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Our goal was to create a treatment that was not only effective but also safe and accessible.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In research published in ACS Nano, teams at UT Austin and the University of Porto developed tin oxide (SnO x ) nanoflakes that converted 810‑nm near‑infrared LED light into localized heat for photothermal cancer therapy. Using a $530 NIR‑LED setup, SnO x‑treated cells saw up to 92% skin‑cancer and 50% colorectal‑cancer cell killing in 30 minutes, while healthy skin cells were unharmed. Authors said further biological and clinical studies were required.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SELF REPLICATING PROBES MAY OPERATE HERE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The Solar System is huge and mostly unexplored, and the probes could be very small.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">John von Neumann had introduced the universal constructor concept that later framed self-replicating (von Neumann) probes, which theoretical studies showed could spread through the galaxy in a few eons. Professor Alex Ellery argued such probes may have already visited and could be operating in the Solar System, and he urged SETI to search for their technosignatures locally (Moon craters, asteroid and Kuiper belts). He revisited resource-driven behavior, prior 3D-printing/self-replication work, reproduction limits, and survival motivations for sending probes.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“In the future, space may be the best place to scale AI compute.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google announced Project Suncatcher, a research effort that investigated placing TPUs on solar-powered satellites to create space-based AI data centers that could harness near-continuous solar power and make panels eight times more productive than Earth. Google published a blog and a preprint, reported tests showing Trillium TPUs survived a radiation dose equivalent to a five-year mission, outlined challenges (high-bandwidth inter-satellite links, collision and debris risk, launch costs) and planned prototype launches with Planet by 2027.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BLACK HOLE SWALLOWS MASSIVE STAR</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“at its brightest, the flare shined with the light of 10 trillion suns.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists recorded the largest and most distant black hole flare to date at an active galactic nucleus from a black hole about 500 million times the mass of the Sun, located 10 billion light years away. They suspected a tidal disruption event in which the AGN consumed an estimated 30-solar-mass star. The flare was first observed in 2018 by the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey; the research appeared in Nature Astronomy.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“At five days, the Google forecast had an error of 165 nautical miles compared to 360 nautical miles for the GFS model.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google DeepMind’s Weather Lab, which started releasing cyclone track forecasts in June, performed exceptionally well in its first Atlantic hurricane season, while the US GFS model performed abysmally. University of Miami researcher Brian McNoldy’s preliminary analysis of 13 storms showed DeepMind’s GDMI had a 165‑nautical‑mile five‑day error versus 360 nm for GFS. GDMI also outperformed National Hurricane Center official forecasts and consensus models and did well on intensity forecasts.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a bright, point-like object, which, however, was not a star”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using JWST, astronomers discovered a ravenous supermassive black hole dubbed BiRD (Big Red Dot) that existed around cosmic noon. BiRD had about 100 million solar masses and its light had traveled roughly 10 billion years. Detected in NIRCam images near quasar J1030+0524, it lacked prior X-ray or radio detections. Spectra showed Paschen gamma and helium absorption, allowing distance and mass estimates; little red dots lacked expected X‑ray emission.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the voids are full of the vacuum of space-time.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article stated that cosmic voids were empty of matter but were filled by quantum fields — the vacuum of space-time — which carried vacuum energy from quantum uncertainty. That vacuum energy was described as dark energy; it had negligible effects in dense regions but dominated voids, driving their expansion and gradually tearing apart the cosmic web. Over roughly 5–20 billion years, the cosmic web was predicted to evaporate as voids expanded.</p>

Sentinel-1D flew 180° apart from Sentinel-1C to optimise global coverage. Both satellites carried C-band synthetic aperture radar and AIS instruments, which delivered high-resolution, all-weather, day-and-night radar imagery for disaster response, environmental and maritime monitoring and climate science, and enabled more frequent, precise AIS vessel tracking.</p>

  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that atmospheres of tidally locked terrestrial planets around flaring M dwarfs could collapse as volatiles condensed on the cold nightside and be lost to stellar erosion. They proposed that nightside ice reservoirs could be re‑vaporized by meteorite impacts to regenerate atmospheres. Prune August (submitted to ApJL) used an energy‑balance model with stochastic impacts and Earth‑like CO outgassing; simulations showed ~10 km impactors every 100 Myr could maintain a detectable atmosphere and were applied to LTT 1445 Ab, Ac and GJ 3929 b.</p>

In rats, the patch reduced damaged heart tissue by 50% and significantly improved cardiac function. The team intended the patch to be applied during bypass surgery to deliver timed, phase-specific therapy to promote tissue healing. The study, led by Erika Wang with senior authors Ana Jaklenec and Robert Langer, appeared in Cell Biomaterials.</p>
