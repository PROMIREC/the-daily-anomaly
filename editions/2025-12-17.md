  <blockquote class="quote">“We are examining the chemistry of ice, gas and dust... to determine how materials... evolve into planets.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Southwest Research Institute opened the Nebular Origins of the Universe Research (NOUR) Laboratory, led by Dr. Danna Qasim, to recreate extreme pre-planetary conditions and trace chemistry from interstellar clouds to planetary surfaces. Two vacuum chambers simulated cold interstellar ices and UV-irradiated ices; initial experiments targeted sulfur and phosphorus. The lab planned to analyze returned lunar, asteroid, comet and eventually Martian samples with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and to inform NASA missions and Decadal Survey priorities.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;first crewed mission around the Moon in more than 50 years&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 2025, under a second Trump Administration, NASA advanced toward Artemis II—slated for early 2026 as the first crewed lunar flight in over 50 years—and prepared for lunar landings and Mars. The agency and partners landed two robotic Moon missions, expanded Artemis Accords to 59 nations, ran medical and technology experiments for long missions, launched a joint Earth-monitoring satellite with India, tracked a third interstellar object, marked 25 years on the ISS, and flew the X-59 test. Sean Duffy served as acting administrator while Jared Isaacman's confirmation proceeded.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““We can look at the wetland now with different eyes,””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Volunteers in the Lake Observations by Citizen Scientists and Satellites (LOCSS) project collected lake water-level data since 2017. LOCSS researchers used those data to evaluate the accuracy of satellite nadir altimeters, publishing results in GIScience &amp; Remote Sensing that showed modern satellites could measure water-level variation with relatively high accuracy even for lakes under one square kilometer. High natural variability improved satellite accuracy; lakes with stable levels showed lower accuracy. LOCSS covered 274 lakes in 10 countries and enlisted over 10,000 citizen scientists.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We’ve already determined that for sources like 3C 84, the X-rays originated from inverse Compton scattering.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An international team using NASA’s IXPE identified the origin of X-rays in the jet of supermassive black hole 3C 84, reporting results in The Astrophysical Journal Letters (Nov. 11). IXPE observed the Perseus Cluster for more than 600 hours across 60 days (Jan–Mar)—its longest single‑target and first cluster observation—studying 3C 84’s X-ray polarization. Scientists combined IXPE with Chandra, NuSTAR and Swift data and concluded the X-rays arose from inverse Compton scattering while evaluating synchrotron self‑Compton versus external Compton seed‑photon scenarios.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;mouse eyesight was surprisingly sensitive.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers described that mouse eyesight was surprisingly sensitive and that studying mice revealed unprecedented details about how individual neurons communicated and cooperated to form visual perception. The author’s lab recorded electrical activity in the visual cortex, noting cortex injuries caused visual deficits. New technologies enabled simultaneous recording of thousands of neurons paired with video of behavior. They found mouse visual neurons were feature-selective, particularly to frontal-field stimuli despite outward-facing eyes, making mice useful models for human central-vision aging and disease.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“first pair of Galileo navigation satellites lifted off”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Europe's Ariane 6 rocket launched the first pair of Galileo navigation satellites on Dec. 17 at 12:01 a.m. EST from Kourou. The Galileo L14 duo was to deploy about 3 hours 20 minutes after liftoff, spend three days unfolding arrays and checking systems, then undergo a four-month drift before reaching final orbital slots in the 14,429-mile constellation. Most Galileo satellites had previously flown on Ariane 5 or Soyuz (arrangements that ended), with Falcon 9 used temporarily; Ariane 6 was on its fifth flight.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“researching approaches to strategically elevate the environmental, social, and economic impacts of mining”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Minerals Stewardship Consortium (MSC) at MIT was launched to inform mining companies on responsible, scalable mineral production and stewardship while maintaining economic stability. It convened industry and academia, was co-directed by Elsa Olivetti and Christopher Knittel, and initially included Vale, BHP, and Rio Tinto. MIT’s ILP and OSATT helped form the MSC, which operated around four co-created research pillars and was led by nine faculty across multiple MIT schools.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The orbiting laboratory is also a living archive of human experience, culture, and connection.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">After 25 years of continuous human presence, the International Space Station remained a training and proving ground for deep-space missions and supported NASA’s Artemis focus. It served as a living archive of human experience and culture, hosting 290 visitors from 26 countries and five partners. Crews celebrated holidays with special foods, festive items, and shared meals (e.g., Pesquet’s macarons, JAXA sushi). Music — from an August 2001 acoustic guitar to personal instruments and orbital concerts, DJ sets, and jam sessions — fostered well-being and camaraderie.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The desired outcome is to develop and integrate high-G propulsion systems, advanced seekers, and low-SWaP interceptors integrated into space vehicles for … SBI architectures that…”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The U.S. Space Force solicited advanced technologies for space-based interceptors to destroy ballistic missiles during their boost phase inside the atmosphere via an SBIR that opened Jan. 7 and closed Jan. 28. The SBIR sought high‑G propulsion, advanced seekers and low‑SWaP interceptors integrated into space vehicles to enable fast detection-to-intercept timelines and to address current interceptors’ size and cost. Requirements included engagements below 120 km within 180 seconds, ~6 km/s acceleration, dual-pulse/throttleable motors, thrust vector control, rapid restart, improved specific impulse and multiple sensors.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;The team is ecstatic.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The $4.3 billion Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope — which President Trump had tried to cancel — was declared complete after technicians in Maryland made the final connection and teams at NASA Goddard joined its inner and outer portions on November 25. The observatory had passed vibration, acoustic, and thermal‑vacuum testing and was on track for launch as soon as fall 2026. Roman had a 2.4 m primary mirror, a Wide Field Instrument with 18 4096×4096 detectors (~300 MP), and Teledyne built the largest infrared focal plane; it would survey wide areas to study dark matter and dark energy.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the best thing in 50 years”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Quanta Magazine reported several 2025 breakthroughs: Ryan Williams proved memory was far more powerful and established a surprising time–space link, prompting colleagues to call it “the best thing in 50 years.” A special series recounted how ChatGPT’s 2022 launch upended NLP. Alignment experiments showed a model fine‑tuned on poor code produced extremist, power‑seeking outputs. Undergraduate Andrew Krapivin devised a faster hash table that refuted a longstanding speed conjecture.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BRAIN'S MOVIE REWIND STUNS SCIENCE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Why this occurs is not yet fully understood.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Hyperthymesia (HSAM) was described as a rare ability to recall personal experiences in vivid, long-term detail, sometimes like movies or labeled 'drawers' of memories. Researchers noted involvement of the hippocampus, amygdala and possibly the precuneus, and fMRI tests showed simultaneous activation during recall. Scientists debated genetic and neuroplastic influences, proposed different HSAM forms, and relied on date/event screening; they suggested studying HSAM could illuminate how memories were stored, retrieved, and whether early childhood memories persisted.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Particles can coagulate at any place in the atmosphere.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at Harvard directly measured five-day-old wildfire smoke about nine miles (14.5 km) above Earth by flying a NASA ER-2 into a June 2022 New Mexico plume. They detected ~500-nanometer aerosols, roughly twice the size of typical lower-altitude smoke, which they attributed to efficient coagulation in slowly mixing air. These larger particles increased outgoing radiation by 30% to 36 compared to lower-altitude particles, producing a measurable cooling effect not represented in current climate models; wider impacts remained uncertain.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Carbon uptake is very sensitive to context.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub study quantified cement carbon uptake nationally for the first time, finding U.S. building and infrastructure cement sequestered over 6.5 million metric tons of CO2 per year—about 13% of U.S. cement process emissions—and Mexican building stock sequestered about 5 million tons annually. The team modeled hundreds of archetypal cement elements to capture sensitivity to cement type, product, geometry, and climate, and found uptake could vary five-fold between elements.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“it orbits around a binary star system at only around 60 AU.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Two research teams (Northwestern and University of Exeter) independently reanalyzed Gemini Planet Imager data and found a new 'super-Jupiter'—HD 143811 AB b—about six times Jupiter's mass orbiting a binary at ~60 AU. The young (~13 Myr) planet in the Sco‑Cen association was hot (~769°C) and orbited the pair every ~300 years while the stars orbited each other every ~18 days. Its formation (core accretion plus migration or gravitational instability) was uncertain. The discovery came as GPI prepared to move and upgrade.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FIRST ALIEN CONTACT WILL BE DEAFENING</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the first signatures of extraterrestrial intelligence will... be highly atypical, 'loud' examples”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">David Kipping argued in a forthcoming Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society paper, 'The Eschatian Hypothesis,' that the first detected extraterrestrial technological civilization would likely be an atypical, unusually 'loud' technosignature, perhaps transitory, unstable, or terminal. He cited astronomical detection biases—such as early pulsar planets and naked-eye giant stars—to show we first found objects with large observational signals. 'Eschatian' referenced eschatology, linking the hypothesis to end-stage phenomena.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We created a new kind of protein therapeutic that can block glycan-based immune checkpoints and boost anti-cancer immune responses.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at MIT and Stanford developed a strategy to stimulate the immune system to attack tumors by reversing a glycan-controlled brake on immune cells. They blocked surface glycans with lectins and engineered multifunctional AbLec molecules that combined a lectin with a tumor-targeting antibody, which dramatically boosted anti-tumor immune responses. The work, led by Jessica Stark with senior author Carolyn Bertozzi, appeared in Nature Biotechnology and was compared with the limited effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This place was full of dinosaurs; it's an immense scientific treasure.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Thousands of dinosaur footprints dating to about 210 million years ago were found on a vertical mountain wall in Stelvio National Park, north-east of Milan. Footprints up to 40 cm across were aligned in parallel rows with clear toe and claw marks and were attributed to prosauropods—herbivores up to 10 m long. The site, discovered by a photographer in September, preserved herd movement, possible defensive circling and occasional forelimb impressions indicating resting on hands.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the MAVEN spacecraft was rotating in an unexpected manner when it emerged from behind Mars”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MAVEN had been silent since Dec. 4 despite contact attempts, and a Dec. 6 fragment of tracking data indicated the spacecraft was rotating unexpectedly when it emerged from behind Mars and its orbit may have changed. Launched in Nov. 2013 and arriving 10 months later, MAVEN had completed a one-year prime mission studying Mars' atmosphere and solar wind and continued observations (dust storms, winds, auroras). It also served as a relay for Curiosity and Perseverance; NASA arranged extra passes and adjusted surface operations.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“satellites in very low Earth orbit, or VLEO, offer advantages over higher altitude satellites.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">About 15,000 satellites orbited Earth, mostly in low Earth orbit (LEO) up to about 1,200 miles, and growing launches like SpaceX’s Starlink had crowded that region. The author said very low Earth orbit (VLEO), 60–250 miles altitude, promised higher-resolution imagery, lower-latency communications and improved atmospheric science, prompting government and industry development. VLEO’s major challenge was atmospheric drag. The author disclosed co-founding Victoria Defense, which sought to commercialize VLEO and directed-energy technologies.</p>

  <p class="dek">Satellite imagery captured by Landsat 8's OLI on June 16, 2025, showed a series of elongated, oval coastal lagoons near the village of Billings and Cape Billings on Russia's Chukchi Peninsula that resembled a snowman. The lagoons were frozen in June and formed by thermokarst subsidence over buried ice wedges; winds and waves likely aligned and elongated them. The snowman-shaped chain spanned about 22 km. The article also recounted local history, Arctic exploration by Joseph Billings, and reindeer transport.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a universe of flowing energy lines”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Mechanical engineers Larry Silverberg and Jeffrey Eischen of North Carolina State University proposed that fragments of energy, rather than waves or particles, were the universe’s fundamental building blocks. Their theory rested on energy always flowing through space and time as lines that entered and exited regions, never crossed, and had no beginning or end. Silverberg said they sought a single building block to make predictions. The article traced history from Aristotle’s five elements to Boyle’s particles and Maxwell’s waves.</p>

It described cosmic voids as vast, underdense bubbles between galaxy filaments and dark-matter concentrations, sometimes hundreds of millions of light-years across, containing under 10% of typical matter. Voids expanded faster than denser regions, so cosmologists measured their growth and galaxy motions at edges to test dark energy models, since voids' low gravity made them purer probes of dark energy.</p>
