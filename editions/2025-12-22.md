  <blockquote class="quote">“Chemical abundances act like a cosmic fingerprint, and the pattern in GS3073 is unlike anything ordinary stars can produce.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using JWST data, an international team led by Devesh Nandal examined galaxy GS 3073 and reported an extreme nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio that ordinary stars could not explain. They modeled Population III &quot;monster stars&quot; of 1,000–10,000 solar masses and found those models reproduced the observed chemical pattern, supporting that supermassive primordial stars existed, may have seeded early supermassive black holes, and could explain the presence of early quasars; GS 3073 also hosted an actively feeding central black hole.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“plasma tail, dust tail”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In November 2025 the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS emerged from behind the Sun and, as it moved outward, ESA's JUICE captured a NavCam image on Nov. 2, 2025, two days before JUICE's closest approach at about 66 million km. Though farther than Mars Express and ExoMars TGO, JUICE recorded a more active comet with a bright coma and two tails (plasma and dust). JUICE collected partial NavCam data and observations from five instruments; full data were expected Feb 18–20, 2026 after antenna-related delays.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;everything seems to be in working order&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">During deployment, IMAP collected first light on its ten primary instruments and they appeared to be working, the Southwest Research Institute reported. Operators at Johns Hopkins exercised instruments en route to the Sun–Earth L1 point. Instruments included CoDICE (a 22-lb ion composition detector), Princeton’s SWAPI, the Solar Wind Electron instrument, NASA’s High-energy Ion Telescope, three ENA sensors, and coordinated-measurement sensors (magnetic-field and interstellar dust). IMAP was weeks from L1 and full science operations were expected by February.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Fram2 circled our planet over the poles”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">2025 was a busy year in spaceflight: multiple records were broken, a new reusable rocket debuted and the first fully successful private moon landing occurred. On March 31, SpaceX launched Fram2, its 17th crewed flight, sending four private astronauts on a 3.5-day polar-orbit mission led by billionaire Chun Wang; the crew performed experiments and shared novel polar views. On Jan. 15, India's SpaDex docked in orbit, making India the fourth nation to do so. ESA's Proba-3 came online to create artificial solar eclipses.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“vowed to build a 'robot army' of 1 million humanoids.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article said humanoid-robot hype had surged, noting China presented humanoids as an economic engine and Elon Musk had vowed a 'robot army' of one million. It described viral footage of Tesla’s Optimus collapsing and earlier demonstrations using humans in disguise, which prompted skepticism, and reported that major tech firms and startups were investing heavily.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">URSIDS LIGHT UP YULE NIGHT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“up to 10 shooting stars may be visible each hour under dark skies.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Ursid meteor shower peaked overnight Dec. 21–22, 2025, during its Dec. 17–26 activity window as Earth passed through debris from comet 8P/Tuttle. Observers saw up to about 10 meteors per hour radiating from near Kochab in Ursa Minor; the best viewing was from evening Dec. 21 through dawn with near-pristine dark skies after December's new moon. Viewers were advised to look about 40° above Kochab, allow 30 minutes for dark adaptation, dress warmly, and could photograph meteors (Canon EOS R7 recommended).</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DYING STARS DEVOUR WORLDS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We saw that these planets are getting rarer [as stars age],”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Our Sun was about halfway through its life, so Earth was too. After stars exhausted hydrogen they expanded over a hundredfold and engulfed close planets; that fate was at least 5 billion years away for our system. Using TESS data, Edward Bryant and Vincent Van Eylen compared main-sequence and post–main-sequence stars and found fewer close-in planets around older stars, arguing this was due to tidal decay, atmospheric stripping and engulfment. They examined 456,941 post–main-sequence stars and found 130 close-in planet candidates.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SHORTEST DAY, LONGEST NIGHT ACROSS NORTH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the shortest day and longest night of the year”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Dec. 21, 2025, the winter solstice occurred, marking the Northern Hemisphere's shortest day and longest night as the Sun reached its lowest point and at noon appeared over the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5° S). The solstice moment occurred at 10:03 a.m. EST (1503 GMT). Earth's 23.5° axial tilt caused the season; the Southern Hemisphere experienced its summer solstice. Earth approached perihelion on Jan. 3, 2026 (~91.4 million miles). Daylight began to slowly increase afterward.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“countdown demonstration test”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Artemis II’s four crew—CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen and NASA astronauts Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman and Christina Koch—departed the Operations and Checkout Building at Kennedy Space Center on Dec. 20, 2025, during a countdown demonstration test. The rehearsal simulated launch-day suiting and boarding of Orion; because the SLS rocket was not yet at the pad, they boarded inside the Vehicle Assembly Building while engineers finished final preparations. Artemis aimed to explore the Moon and lay groundwork for Mars.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The body was intact. The clothes were not even torn.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Naseeruddin, a 31-year-old Pakistani man who vanished in June 1997 in Supat Valley, Kohistan, was found on July 31 when a shepherd discovered his intact, mummified body with an identity card. His family had searched for years. He had lain frozen in glacial ice for 28 years; rapid freezing had protected the body from moisture and oxygen. Regional glacier melt, driven by anthropogenic climate change and decreased snowfall, exposed the remains. The article compared this preservation to finds like Ötzi.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MOON LAUNCHPADS COULD CRACK</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;simulants are called simulants for a reason,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Engineers lacked data on lunar materials, so Shirley Dyke's Purdue team published a paper in Acta Astronautica describing how to build a lunar landing pad with minimal prior knowledge of regolith properties. They noted Earth landing pads were well understood but shipping concrete to the Moon was prohibitive, simulants were imperfect, and sintered regolith’s mechanical and thermal properties were poorly known. Sintered regolith was expected to be brittle and thermally insulative, heating only the top ~8 cm and causing cracking during launches.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Several Waymo autonomous vehicles were stranded at San Francisco intersections after a power outage disabled traffic lights. Waymo suspended its ride‑hailing and said teams were coordinating with city officials. The outage followed a fire at a PG&amp;E substation and affected 130,000 customers; crews restored power to 110,000, leaving 21,000 in the Presidio, Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and downtown. Waymo did not explain why cars stopped; observers flagged a possible Waymo Driver signal fault, and Elon Musk said Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected.</p>
