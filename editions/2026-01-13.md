  <blockquote class="quote">“The Keck Observatory data is what allowed us to understand the true scale of this phenomenon.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers led by UC Irvine and Caltech IPAC reported the largest, most extended relativistic jet yet seen in nearby galaxy VV340a, a spear-like outflow reaching about 20,000 light-years and showing helical, precessing structure. Combined Keck KCWI, JWST infrared and VLA radio data revealed the most extended coronal gas (thousands of parsecs), a jet-driven gas removal of ~20 solar masses per year that halted star formation, and the unexpected presence of such powerful jets in a young, merging galaxy. Results were published in Science.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Deployment of 29 Starlink satellites confirmed.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A SpaceX Falcon 9 launched 29 Starlink satellites (Group 6-98) into low Earth orbit from Cape Canaveral's SLC-40 on Jan. 12, lifting off at 4:08 p.m. EST (2108 GMT) and reaching space about nine minutes later. The satellites were deployed about 50 minutes after liftoff following a coast and a second upper-stage burn. First stage Booster 1078 flew its 13th mission and landed on the droneship A Shortfall of Gravitas. The launch was SpaceX's fifth of the year; Starlink numbered nearly 9,500 active satellites.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“pure muscle.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists in 2024 announced a new giant anaconda species after a 2022 National Geographic expedition that included Will Smith for Pole to Pole. A clip showed Smith, venom expert Bryan Fry and Waorani guides capturing a 16–17‑ft female so Fry could take a scale to test pollutants and genetics; analyses identified the northern green anaconda, Eunectes akayama, genetically distinct from E. murinus and likely separated ~10 million years ago. Its range included Venezuela, Colombia, Suriname, French Guiana and northern Brazil. Series premiered 13 January 2026.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The space station gives scientists a laboratory unlike any on Earth.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">For more than 25 years humans had lived and worked continuously aboard the International Space Station, conducting microgravity research that transformed life on Earth and shaped future exploration. Experiments ranged from growing food and sequencing DNA to studying disease and simulating Mars missions. Studies such as the Angiex Cancer Therapy and NanoRacks‑PCG investigations produced larger, better‑ordered protein crystals and informed cancer, cardiovascular, bone, and immune‑system research, while Veggie tested plant growth for long missions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““We have shown how variation in our genetic code can alter how we perceive pain.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers in Europe reported that three Neanderthal-derived variants in the SCN9A gene were associated with increased sensitivity to skin pricks after mustard-oil sensitization in modern humans. The SCN9A gene encoded sodium channels that helped nerve cells signal pain; carrying all three variants produced greater prick sensitivity than carrying only one, while variants were not linked to heat or pressure pain tolerance. Authors referenced earlier work suggesting Neanderthals were more pain-sensitive and said further research was needed.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“density-free regime”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences operating the EAST tokamak reported a &quot;density-free regime&quot; that surpassed the Greenwald plasma-density limit by 65 percent. They organized plasma–wall interactions from start-up by adjusting initial fuel gas pressure and applying electron cyclotron resonance heating, preventing wall-induced destabilization. Authors said the result suggested a scalable pathway to extend tokamak density limits. The team aimed to reproduce this regime under high-performance conditions, while noting materials and other hurdles remained before fusion power could be realized.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Global ocean warming continued unabated in 2025 in response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations and recent reductions in sulfate aerosols.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">New research in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences reported that global ocean temperatures set another record in 2025, the eighth consecutive year of records. Led by Yuying Pan, over 50 scientists from 31 institutions estimated oceans absorbed 23 ZJ in 2025 — about 37 years of 2023 global primary energy — with 33% of ocean area in its top-three warmest and 57% in its top five. Authors attributed warming to increased greenhouse gases and reduced sulfate aerosols, calling ocean heat content a robust long-term climate indicator.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">HUMAN SOULS REDUCED TO EQUATIONS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Math IS the universe, it IS matter.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">This article, Part 3 of a series on the mathematical universe hypothesis, described Roger Penrose’s Triangle of Reality (math, matter, mind) and how the hypothesis broke it by claiming math constituted matter and mind. It argued that conscious beings were self-aware mathematical substructures — equations — using the Mandelbrot fractal and Tegmark’s bird (external) versus frog (internal) perspectives. It concluded there was no free will, time, or space, only timeless mathematical relations, likened to software.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">EXPERTS FURIOUS AS MARS MISSION AXED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;we are deeply concerned by the cancellation of the MSR program,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The U.S. House passed a minibus appropriations bill that discontinued the existing NASA–ESA Mars Sample Return (MSR) program, with the Senate vote pending. The bill stated it did not support the MSR program while acknowledging that MSR-developed technologies were critical to future science and human exploration. The Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group and chair Victoria Hamilton expressed deep concern, noting MSR had been the top planetary priority in two Decadal Surveys and Perseverance had been collecting samples in Jezero Crater since early 2021.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“snow drought”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists warned that much less winter snow had fallen on the Himalayas, leaving many areas bare and rocky. Most winters in the last five years had shown declines versus the 1980–2020 average; higher temperatures meant rapid melt and more rain at lower elevations, a change attributed in part to global warming and described in studies as a 'snow drought.' Reduced snowfall and vanishing glaciers threatened river supplies for drinking, irrigation and hydropower, increased fire risk, and destabilised slopes, raising rockfalls, landslides and glacial lake outbursts.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“While we always have to acknowledge the human cost of a disaster, this is an extraordinary geophysical image.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on October 28, 2025, as a category 5 with 295 km/h winds and extensive damage. As it passed over the Caribbean, it stirred carbonate mud from Pedro Bank—about 25 m deep and slightly larger than Delaware—producing a bright Maya-blue sediment plume visible in a MODIS Terra image on October 30. Scientists estimated the plume covered ~37,500 km2, believed the largest such event in the satellite era, and traced currents, eddies and Ekman transport.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We're leaving you all with a lot of work, but also with a lot of knowledge&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA returned four Crew-11 astronauts to Earth early due to a medical concern affecting one crew member. The crew—pilot Mike Fincke, commander Zena Cardman and mission specialists Kimiya Yui and Oleg Platonov—packed personal items into their Dragon for undocking on Jan. 14 and landing on Jan. 15. Fincke relinquished ISS command to Russian cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchov in a ceremony; NASA had ordered the first-ever ISS medical evacuation after a Jan. 7 medical issue.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We are in constant contact with NASA on Envision.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA said it remained uncertain whether NASA would participate in its Envision Venus mission despite construction starting in 2025. Envision planned to map Venus's atmosphere and geology and relied on NASA's VenSar synthetic-aperture radar (3 ft/10 m resolution), whose funding was at risk under the Trump administration's 2026 budget. ESA officials urged contingency planning — including building VenSar in Europe — to meet a 2033 launch window; JPL had passed VenSar's preliminary design review.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Ocean heat content is in many ways the most reliable thermostat of the planet.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Since 2018, researchers reported that 2025 set a record — the eighth consecutive year of rising ocean heat content — with oceans absorbing 23 zettajoules in 2025 versus 16 in 2024. A team of more than 50 scientists from the US, Europe, and China produced the study. The article said oceans took up over 90% of excess atmospheric heat, much of which moved into deeper layers even though 2025 sea-surface temperatures were slightly lower than 2024; authors gave analogies such as 12 Hiroshima bombs.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;Suddenly, I felt like my head was exploding from the inside.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The raid that ended Nicolás Maduro’s rule was portrayed as a coordinated modern military operation. Afterward, a viral WhatsApp audio and social posts claimed U.S. forces used a “sonic weapon” that made Venezuelan troops bleed from the nose and vomit blood; an English translation described radar failures, many drones, and sudden incapacitation. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt amplified the eyewitness account on X, but the U.S. did not confirm any acoustic or directed-energy use and the claim lacked independent corroboration.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““There are electrical currents going through your body all the time, and they’re doing things.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Results published in Nature showed that epithelial cells used bioelectric signals to coordinate extrusion, a process that ejected sick or struggling cells to maintain tissue health. As tissue grew and cells packed tightly, membrane currents increased; weak or energy‑starved cells failed to compensate, lost water, shrank and were marked for death. The finding placed bioelectricity among non-neural mechanisms that guided cellular decisions and tissue homeostasis.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">EARTH'S DOWN IS LOCAL, SAYS EXPERT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“down could be defined as being below the plane of the solar system, which is known as the ecliptic.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An expert answered that planetary orbits were nearly in a single plane—the ecliptic—so ‘above’ and ‘below’ could be defined relative to that plane. Local down depended on Earth’s gravity and varied by location; a line through Earth that was down for one person pointed up to someone on the opposite side. By convention, observers above the ecliptic saw planets orbit counterclockwise, from below clockwise. The Sun was one of about 100 billion Milky Way stars, which orbited near the galactic plane.</p>

  <p class="dek">NASA launched Pandora, a small $20 million satellite, to improve exoplanet studies by the James Webb Space Telescope. Webb, launched in 2021 for over $10 billion, had a large mirror and sensitive spectroscopy but stellar variability and stellar atmospheric signals (spots, flares, water vapor) contaminated exoplanet spectra. Pandora rode a Falcon 9 into a sun-synchronous polar orbit (~613 km), and after commissioning it was intended to monitor host-star variability to help separate stellar and planetary spectral signals.</p>

  <p class="dek">On Jan. 11, 2026, a SpaceX Falcon 9 launched NASA’s Pandora telescope from Vandenberg Space Force Base to study exoplanets and their host stars, complementing the James Webb Space Telescope. A University of Arizona co‑investigator said Pandora was built to remove stellar contamination—especially starspots and upper‑atmosphere water vapor—which the team's 2018–2019 studies identified as the transit light source effect that would limit Webb. NASA had proposed a fast mission in 2018 to tackle this problem.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This is the most comprehensive work on the global ammonia landscape.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT Energy Initiative researchers reported that ammonia was energy-dense, carbon-free, produced and shipped at scale, but its current manufacturing had an enormous carbon footprint though cleaner production methods existed. They built the largest dataset to quantify economic and environmental impacts of global ammonia supply chains across 63 countries, evaluated country-specific economics and low- and no-carbon technologies, and found conventional ammonia with carbon capture could cut global GHGs nearly 71% for a 23.2% cost increase, while electrolyzed ammonia could cut 99.7% for a 46% cost increase.</p>

They published a “roadmap” paper in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews outlining planned experiments; authors included Daniel Freeman, Brian Odegaard, Seung‑Schik Yoo, and Matthias Michel. The noninvasive technique transmitted acoustic waves through the skull to a few‑millimeter target, reached deeper with greater resolution than magnetic or electrical stimulation, and could stimulate specific brain structures in healthy subjects to probe neural substrates of perception, pain, vision, and thought.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“A supernova that happens within a dense cloud of gas will have a very different effect than one that occurs in a large void.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A radio study of Andromeda used VLA maps of cold neutral hydrogen and ALMA molecular-gas data to compare dense and void regions with locations of red supergiants, Wolf–Rayet stars, and supernova remnants. It found only about one third of red supergiants and supernova remnants lay in higher-density molecular hydrogen, with most in low-density regions, implying supernova shock waves played a smaller role in triggering star formation than expected. Wolf–Rayet stars were typically near dense gas; authors planned simulations and wider surveys.</p>
