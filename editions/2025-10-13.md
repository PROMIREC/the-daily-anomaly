  <h3 class="hed">COSMIC LENS UNCOVERS TINY DARK HALO</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“pinch in the gravitational arc”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An international team led by Dr Devon Powell at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics detected the smallest dark-matter clump yet: about 1 million solar masses, roughly 10 billion light-years away (as seen when the universe was 6.5 billion years old). They combined radio observatories including the Green Bank Telescope to create an Earth-sized interferometer, used gravitational lensing of B1938+666 and gravitational imaging to spot a subtle distortion, ran new supercomputer modelling, found no electromagnetic emission, and reported results in Nature Astronomy supporting cold dark matter.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BETELGEUSE'S SECRET COMPANION EXPOSED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“absolutely insane.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University confirmed that Betelgeuse had a companion, nicknamed “Betelbuddy,” after exploiting a brief observational window around 6 December when the companion reached maximum separation. They obtained Director’s Discretionary Time on Hubble and Chandra, and the deepest Chandra X-ray data showed no accretion, ruling out compact objects. The companion was identified as a young, roughly solar-mass star and its presence helped explain Betelgeuse’s six-year brightness cycle, but challenged binary formation models due to the extreme mass ratio.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">GRAPHENE GOES COMMERCIAL AT LAST</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The material when it came out of academia was hyped to death … but the challenge is going from lab to fab”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Two decades after graphene was first produced at the University of Manchester in 2004, it was hailed as a wonder material but some UK companies had succeeded while others struggled to commercialise it. China led production; UK projects included a graphene‑enhanced low‑carbon concrete at a Northumbrian Water site. Entrepreneurs such as Ben Jensen emphasised scaling and price challenges; Bayer had closed a carbon‑nanotube pilot and nanotubes were mainly used as fillers. More promising were graphene optical microchips from 2D Photonics/CamGraPhIC claiming higher, cheaper data transmission.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STARSHIP FACES CRITICAL TEST</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“flight experiments gathering data for the next generation Super Heavy booster”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX prepared for Starship’s 11th flight test on October 13 at 7:15 PM ET. After an August test that deployed eight dummy Starlink satellites, this flight again carried eight Starlink simulators and used a reused Super Heavy with 24 of 33 flight‑proven Raptor engines. Goals were to gather data for a next‑gen booster, stress‑test Starship’s heatshield, and demonstrate return‑style maneuvers. The booster was expected to splash in the Gulf of Mexico and Starship in the Indian Ocean; no booster catch was planned.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">UNIVERSE IS COSMIC MEMORY VAULT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the universe does not just evolve. It remembers.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers said physics rested on general relativity and quantum mechanics, which clashed over black holes, dark matter, dark energy and cosmic origins. They proposed information as the fundamental ingredient in a quantum memory matrix (QMM). QMM posited discrete spacetime cells that stored quantum imprints of interactions so the universe remembered events. A reversible imprint operator mathematically conserved information during black hole evaporation, and the framework was extended from gravity to the other forces.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">INTERSTELLAR COMET SPITS WATER VAPOR</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS appeared to behave like a comet, releasing water vapor and producing a coma and tail. ESA's ExoMars TGO (CaSSIS) and Mars Express (HRSC) imaged it from about 30 million km; CaSSIS detected the coma but not the ~1 km nucleus, and the ~56,000 km tail was too faint. Mars Express and TGO recorded spectra (OMEGA, SPICAM, NOMAD); teams planned combined analysis and further observations, with JUICE positioned to observe in November.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STARSHIP MEGAROCKET ROARS TONIGHT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Both elements were designed to be fully and rapidly reusable.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX planned to launch Starship Flight 11 on Monday evening (Oct. 13) during a 75-minute window opening at 7:15 p.m. EDT from Starbase in South Texas, with Space.com streaming live about 30 minutes beforehand. The vehicle comprised a Super Heavy booster and a Starship upper stage, both designed to be reusable. Flight 11 aimed to mirror Flight 10’s profile, test a new Super Heavy landing-burn configuration, gather return-to-Starbase data, and used a booster that had flown Flight 8.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MARS GREENING NOW WITHIN REACH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the question is no longer whether terraforming is physically possible, but whether we should even pursue it”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Terraforming was defined as altering a world to be habitable. Mars had long been dismissed, but a Pioneer Labs summary by Dr Erika DeBenedictis for a 2025 workshop argued lower launch costs, synthetic biology and climate modelling made it plausible. They proposed phases: warming Mars with aerosols or greenhouse gases to melt ice into a ~4 million km2, 300 m-deep ocean; introducing engineered extremophiles/algae to produce oxygen within decades; and a centuries-to-millennia effort to build an oxygen atmosphere, starting inside 100 m domes. Unknowns remained.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MIDNIGHT MOON MEETS JUPITER TWINS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“pleasing view of the moon”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Just after midnight on 14 October, the Moon passed near Jupiter and the brightest stars of Gemini, Castor and Pollux, producing a pleasing conjunction visible from London. A chart showed the view from London at 00:30 BST; Gemini had risen earlier and remained visible until dawn. The Moon was almost at last quarter (47% illuminated), transitioning from waning gibbous to waning crescent; Jupiter rose in Gemini around midnight and appeared bright below the Moon; the event was visible from the southern hemisphere toward the north-east.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MICROBES SURVIVE BRUTAL SPACE RIDE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Our research showed an important type of bacteria for our health can withstand rapid gravity changes, acceleration and deacceleration.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at RMIT University sent Bacillus subtilis spores in a 3D-printed holder on a sounding rocket to test effects of launch, microgravity and reentry. The spores endured accelerations up to 13 g, about six minutes of weightlessness at ~162 miles (260 km), and decelerations up to 30 g while spinning ~220 times per second; after recovery they showed no structural damage and grew as on Earth. The study was presented as the first real-flight test with implications for life-support and astronaut microbiomes.</p>
