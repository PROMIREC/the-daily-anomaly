  <blockquote class="quote">“Air Quality Monitors (AQM)”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Toxicology and Environmental Chemistry (TEC) monitored airborne contaminants in spacecraft air and water. In-flight monitors provided real-time insight on the ISS using Air Quality Monitors (AQM), CO2 monitors, a compound specific analyzer for combustion products (CSA-CP), the colorimetric water quality monitoring kit (CWQMK), and the ISS total organic carbon analyzer (TOCA). Archival air samples (grab sample containers and formaldehyde badges) and Water Kit potable, condensate, and wastewater samples were collected and returned to Earth for post-flight characterization. U.S. and Russian water recovery systems processed atmospheric moisture and U.S. urine distillate into potable water.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The components each describe basic actions in an energy system: transfer, storage, transformation, and entering or exiting the network.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An MIT Energy Initiative team developed Macro, a computer-modeling tool to help utility planners, regulators, and researchers design and operate future electricity and energy-intensive infrastructure. Macro let planners input generating units, demand, costs, technologies, and policy constraints to evaluate options that minimized prices and met emissions and reliability goals, and it accounted for co-dependencies between industrial sectors. Built with Princeton and NYU collaborators, Macro extended earlier GenX and DOLPHYN models using four components (transfer, storage, transformation, entry/exit).</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we are moving through the cosmos at about 360 km/s”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article stated motion was relative and that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole indicated the Milky Way had moved through the cosmos at about 360 km/s. Böhme et al. compared that to a statistical dipole from radio-galaxy sky surveys and found a larger speed in the same direction, discrepant at 5.4σ. They noted radio galaxies probed billions of light-years so local bias was unlikely and suggested the result might signal a tension with the standard cosmological model.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“an enhanced version of this concept could realistically provide the first in situ investigation of a visitor from another star system”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 2029 ESA planned to launch Comet Interceptor to wait in space and later rendezvous with a long-period comet; a white paper ('Intercepting Interstellar Objects') led by Colin Snodgrass proposed using this pre-positioned architecture to visit an interstellar object like comet 3l/ATLAS. The article reviewed past comet missions (ICE 1985, Halley 1985, Stardust 1999/sample 2006, Deep Impact, Rosetta) and argued an in-situ ISO study could illuminate differences in planet formation revealed by exoplanet surveys.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We rely on a combination of vestibular, proprioceptive, and visual information to build an estimate of our body’s state.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers found that humans, mice, and fruit flies used an error-correction process to guide foot placement and maintain stability while walking. Nidhi Seethapathi and Antoine De Comite analyzed locomotion data from other labs collected in ordinary environments (not treadmills) and reported that missteps and minor imbalances predicted subsequent foot placement across animals with two, four, or six legs. Their results were published Oct. 21 in PNAS and were said to inform studies linking animal models to human balance.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;in the future.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Uber launched autonomous-vehicle rides as an option in Dallas in partnership with Avride. A small fleet of Avride’s Hyundai Ioniq 5 vehicles initially provided rides with a person in the front seat, and Uber said it planned fully driverless operation in the future. Riders could set preferences to increase being paired with a robotaxi and could switch to a traditional driver. Uber had begun its Avride partnership in October 2024 and maintained other robotaxi collaborations.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The static magnetic field 'twists' the light.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described how physicists Benjamin Assouline and Amir Capua (Hebrew University) published in Scientific Reports that light's magnetic field, previously considered negligible, interacted with atomic spins. Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation they showed light produced a magnetic torque akin to a static magnetic field; in terbium gallium garnet this magnetic component produced about 17% of atomic rotation in visible wavelengths and up to 75% in infrared (up to 1,300 nm). Commentators noted implications for spin manipulation and spin-based devices.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“EarthCARE satellite was used to calculate directly how clouds and aerosols influence Earth’s energy balance.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">EarthCARE, launched in May 2024 by ESA with JAXA, was used to calculate directly how clouds and aerosols influenced Earth’s energy balance and to improve climate-model representations. Its four instruments (CPR, ATLID, MSI) combined radar, lidar and multispectral imagery to derive vertical cloud and precipitation water content, particle size and 3D structure; MSI imagery extrapolated profiles across the satellite track. An animation illustrated ‘radiative closure’ over Typhoon Ragasa on 20 September 2025.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SOUTHERN HUMANS ISOLATED UNTIL RECENTLY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“remained isolated until only about 1,000 years ago.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A South African–Swedish team extracted genomes from southern African skeletons dated about 1,000–10,000 years old and identified a distinct, relatively large ancestral population outside previously described human variation. Principal coordinate analysis placed these genomes far from East, West and Stone Age Malawi clusters. The older genomes showed no evidence of outside admixture until about 1,000–1,200 years ago, and present-day southern African hunter‑gatherers were largely derived from these ancestors.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SATELLITES DROWN OUT HUBBLE'S VISION</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“For the first time, we found something that may actually be worse in the future.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers warned that rapid growth in satellite constellations had increased light pollution and would increasingly contaminate space-telescope images. A NASA study in Nature projected satellite trails could affect nearly 40% of Hubble images and up to 96% for three other telescopes over the next decade; Hubble had 4.3% affected images from 2018–2021. Simulations predicted averages of 2.14 satellites per Hubble exposure and 92 per exposure for China’s Xuntian. Reflected light risked obscuring scientific signals; researchers called for darker satellites, timing strategies and regulatory coordination.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SATELLITE FLOOD BLINDS ORBITAL EYES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“nearly 100 satellite tracks in every exposure”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Three NASA astronomers released an analysis showing planned orbital telescopes would have images criss-crossed by planned satellite constellations, including a fully expanded Starlink and competitors. They found at least one proposed observatory would have averaged nearly 100 satellite tracks per exposure, and that measures to protect ground-based astronomy could worsen orbital impacts. Using FCC filings they judged current satellites were only 3% of the planned decade total and examined Hubble, SPHEREx, Xuntian, and ARRAKIHS.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SOFT ROBOTS POISED TO CONQUER OCEANS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This turns everyday motion into a power source,&quot; said Professor Jun Zou.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at Zhejiang University developed self-powered soft robots that harvested ambient motion to operate, inspired by the lymphatic system. They 3D-printed soft fiber pumps (SFPs) that bent, twisted, and stretched; two designs—spiral-electrode (high-performance) and parallel-electrode (durable)—were reported. A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was integrated to convert motion into electricity, eliminating batteries. Reported applications included wearable temperature-regulating gloves, medical devices, remote robotics, deep-sea exploration, and space.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">CHINA'S DEBUT REUSABLE ROCKET EXPLODES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“An anomaly occurred as the first stage approached the designated recovery zone. No personnel safety issues occurred.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The first test flight of Landspace's 66-meter stainless-steel Zhuque-3 launched from Jiuquan on Dec. 2 reached orbit and successfully placed its expendable second stage, but its reusable first stage lost an engine during the landing burn, caught fire and crashed in a fiery explosion near the target recovery zone. Landspace reported no personnel injuries, said it would investigate the anomaly, and described the flight as a technical success after verifying recovery systems, engine throttling and attitude control.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Lie groups (pronounced &quot;Lee&quot;) are crucial to some of the most fundamental theories in physics.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The text described groups as mathematical objects defined by simple rules that illuminated diverse problems, such as which polynomial equations were solvable and how atoms arranged in crystals. It said Lie groups, identified in the early 1870s, blended group theory, geometry and linear algebra and were crucial to fundamental physics and influential in number theory and chemistry. It contrasted discrete symmetries (the triangle’s six-element group) with continuous symmetries (rotations of a Frisbee forming SO(2)).</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a kind of crater”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA’s Mars Express spotted a 'martian butterfly' that was a crater formed by a low-angle space-rock impact, which flung two lobes of material north and south forming winglike raised ground. The oval main crater measured roughly 20 km by 15 km in Idaeus Fossae (northern lowlands). Some wing debris appeared fluidised, implying mixing with subsurface water or ice. Surroundings featured mesas, layered volcanic material, lava deposits and wrinkle ridges.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It is therefore essential to fully understand the mechanisms at work in this phenomenon, which could erode the atmosphere of certain rocky exoplanets.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">WASP-107 b, a “super-puff” exoplanet 211 light‑years away with a ~5.7‑day orbit, was observed with JWST/NIRISS and was found to be steadily losing helium. Multiple transits showed pre‑, during‑ and post‑transit helium absorption consistent with a giant tail extending tens of planetary radii. The escaping atmosphere included water, ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide. The Nature Astronomy study linked these findings to atmospheric formation and evolution and showcased JWST’s capabilities.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the flight performance of our robot was comparable to insects”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers demonstrated an aerial microrobot that flew with speed and agility comparable to bumblebees. They designed an AI-based, two-part control scheme that increased the robot’s speed by about 450% and acceleration by about 250% versus prior demonstrations, enabling it to execute gymnastic flight paths and complete 10 consecutive somersaults in 11 seconds despite wind disturbances. The team published the work in Science Advances and cited search-and-rescue as a potential application.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It's forcing us to rethink our theoretical framework.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers using JWST reported a mature grand-design spiral galaxy, Alaknanda, at redshift ~4 (about 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang). The Astronomy and Astrophysics paper by Rashi Jain and Yogesh Wadadekar (NCRA–TIFR, Pune) described Alaknanda as ~10 kpc across, ~16 billion solar masses and a well-formed disk with two symmetric spiral arms recovered by GALFIT. The finding contradicted expectations that spirals required much longer to form and was said to force a rethink of galaxy-formation models.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Lost Galaxy”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope imaged spiral galaxy NGC 4535, about 50 million light-years away in Virgo, nicknamed the 'Lost Galaxy' due to its faintness. Hubble resolved its spiral arms, central bar and young star clusters surrounded by pink H II regions, indicating very young, massive stars that heated their birth clouds and later exploded as supernovae. The image used PHANGS program data and contributed to a catalog of ~50,000 H II regions; Hubble had imaged NGC 4535 in 2021.</p>

  <p class="dek">LandSpace launched its methane-fueled Zhuque-3 (Vermillion Bird-3) rocket on its inaugural flight from Jiuquan, China. The 66 m, nine-engine first stage produced more than 1.7 million pounds of thrust; the upper stage achieved target orbit. The stainless-steel booster survived reentry and nearly reached a dune-field recovery pad, but an anomaly during the landing burn caused a high-speed impact and fireball near the pad; recovery tests failed, no injuries were reported, and the company opened an investigation.</p>

  <p class="dek">Waymo began supervised robotaxi trials in four US cities — Philadelphia, Baltimore, St. Louis and Pittsburgh — using human safety monitors. It planned fully driverless deployment after data-collection, as done in Miami, and targeted launches in five Texas and Florida cities in 2026. Its service already operated in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Atlanta, Austin and Bay Area, with San Diego, Las Vegas and Detroit forthcoming. Waymo obtained temporary AV testing permission in parts of New York and planned a London partnership with Moove under upcoming UK pilot rules.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;know what they don’t know.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers developed a method that let large language models dynamically allocate computational effort while solving problems, adjusting budget based on question difficulty and the likelihood that partial solutions would lead to correct answers. It addressed fixed-budget waste or insufficiency, cut computation to as little as half of existing methods while maintaining comparable accuracy across varied difficulties, and enabled smaller models to match or outperform larger ones on complex tasks. The technique was presented at NeurIPS and could reduce energy use and aid time‑sensitive, high‑stakes applications.</p>

  <p class="dek">Google proposed Project Suncatcher, an 81-satellite LEO constellation to harvest sunlight and run AI data centers in space, beaming data back to Earth rather than power. The plan aimed to exploit abundant solar energy and dump heat into the vacuum, motivated by rising computing demand and Earth data centers’ large electricity use (a medium-sized center could power about 16,500 homes). The University of Michigan author applauded the idea but warned it would face growing space-debris problems.</p>

  <p class="dek">NASA’s Perseverance rover recorded electrical discharges and mini‑sonic booms in Martian dust devils, confirming a long‑suspected phenomenon via SuperCam microphone and electromagnetic data; the discovery was published Nov. 26 in Nature. Over the mission it detected 55 distinct electrical events (first on sol 215 in 2021), 16 while dust devils passed over the rover. Researchers attributed the sparks to triboelectric charging of dust in Mars’s thin atmosphere and noted implications for atmospheric chemistry, climate, habitability, and mission design.</p>
