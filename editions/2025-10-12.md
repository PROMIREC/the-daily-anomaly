  <blockquote class="quote">“the moon and Jupiter will be separated by roughly a little more than half of a fist.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On the night of Oct. 13 (and predawn Oct. 14) the last-quarter moon rose east-northeast before midnight and appeared about 6 degrees to Jupiter's left—roughly a bit more than half a fist at arm's length. The moon was 235,000 miles away and Jupiter 477 million miles. Jupiter was in Gemini near Pollux, reached 30° by 2:30 a.m.; telescopes showed cloud bands, a shrinking, wobbling Great Red Spot, and the four Galilean moons (Callisto, Europa and Io on one side, Ganymede opposite).</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Reducing microplastic exposure where possible is therefore a wise and important precaution.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Microplastics were reported in blood, placentas, lungs and even human brains, with one study estimating about 5g in cerebral organs. Researchers exposed human gut bacteria to common microplastics and found shifts in bacterial populations and chemicals that mirrored patterns linked to depression and colorectal cancer; Dr Christian Pacher-Deutsch presented the findings. Microplastics shed from everyday items could penetrate tissues and cells, effects remained largely unknown, and animal studies showed exposure altered mouse behaviour.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">LEMMON COMET BRIGHTENS, EYES TURN SKYWARD</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Comet Lemmon had brightened from magnitude +21.5 upon its discovery in January to approximately +5.7.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The past month, Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) had brightened rapidly ahead of perihelion and was expected to become visible to the naked eye in mid–late October. Solar heating had produced a coma and tail, and the comet had brightened from magnitude +21.5 at discovery to about +5.7, just above the ∼+6 naked‑eye limit though moonlight could hinder viewing. It moved past Chi Ursae Majoris, toward Cor Caroli, made closest approach to Earth on Oct. 21 in Boötes, and passed under Serpens’ head on Oct. 26–27.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““Westerner””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A 2018 hillside road reconstruction in Taiyuan, Shanxi, uncovered a Tang-dynasty tomb whose discovery was reported recently. Long Zhen said painted scenes of daily life—women grinding flour, men making pasta, camels—covered the tomb in the “figures under the tree” style. Experts dated the occupant to 736 AD, a 63-year-old man buried with his wife. One painted figure had blond hair and a beard and was identified as a “Westerner,” likely a Sogdian from Central Asia.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">RARE SUBALPINE RAT PHOTOGRAPHED AFTER DECADES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“it cannot be recorded by standard methods of small rodent trapping”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Zoologist František Vejmělka documented Mallomys istapantap, the Subalpine Woolly Rat, in the wild on Mount Wilhelm, Papua New Guinea, and captured photo and video from a camera trap after eight nights. The cat-sized, nocturnal herbivore (up to 85 cm) had been known only from a 1989 description, a 1995 illustration, and museum specimens. Locals aided Vejmělka; he reported habitat, morphology (dark fur, white-tipped tail, females slightly larger) and a novel yellow chest streak; findings were published in Mammalia.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">COLOSSAL SOLAR HOLE COULD SPARK AURORAS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“peak Kp index of 5”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A large coronal hole in the Sun's atmosphere was facing Earth and sent a high-speed solar wind stream that was predicted to arrive late Saturday into Sunday (Oct. 11–12), NOAA and the U.K. Met Office said. Geomagnetic activity was expected to rise late Oct. 11, peaking between 5 a.m. and 5 p.m. EDT on Oct. 12 with possible G1 (Kp=5) storm conditions that could produce auroras as far south as Michigan and Maine. The feature had persisted last month and reappeared every 27 days.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Each distorted arc, ring or multiplied galaxy image acted as a natural cosmic magnifying glass.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA's James Webb Space Telescope helped astronomers locate sites of gravitational lensing using eight images from the COSMOS-Web program. The COSMOS-WEB Lens Survey (COWLS) inspected more than 42,000 lensing candidates by eye and identified over 400 promising systems; the collage showed the eight most spectacular. The article noted Einstein's prediction that massive objects bent space-time, producing arcs, multiple images and Einstein rings, and said JWST revealed greater detail than Hubble.</p>
