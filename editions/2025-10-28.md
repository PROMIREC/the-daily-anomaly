  <h3 class="hed">WOVEN BASKETS BEAT PLASTIC BINS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“These woven designs provided almost the same stiffness as nonwoven structures, such as plastic bins.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">University of Michigan structures and materials scientists investigated why traditional ribbonlike woven baskets were load-bearing and resilient. They designed small woven units assembled into larger structures and found the woven designs provided nearly the same stiffness as nonwoven containers (such as plastic bins) but did not fracture or fail under bending and twisting the way continuous-sheet nonwoven systems did. The article noted reed-strip weaving had been used for thousands of years and had been reemployed in engineering.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“All they had to do was define specific sizes for individual cells.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder devised a modeling approach that introduced deliberate imperfections to better reproduce Turing patterns, and published the work in Matter. They built on Turing’s activator–inhibitor diffusion idea and on a 2023 model by Ankur Gupta and Benjamin Alessio that added diffusiophoresis to produce sharp hexagonal boxfish patterns, which were unrealistically uniform. In the new work Gupta and Siamak Mirfendereski achieved more natural, multiscale, imperfect patterns by defining specific sizes for individual cells.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;At a certain viewing distance, it didn’t matter how many pixels you add.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Cambridge and Meta found that in an average living room a 4K or 8K television offered no noticeable benefit over a similarly sized 2K screen. Published in Nature Communications, they measured human resolution limits with a 27in 4K monitor moved to different distances and 18 participants who identified one-pixel lines versus grey. Average limits were 94 PPD (greyscale), 89 PPD (red/green) and 53 PPD (yellow/violet). A follow-up text-sharpness test involved 12 participants.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a pure perspective miracle”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Gianluca Masi captured footage on Oct. 24 of a glowing meteor trail that appeared to coil around Comet Lemmon's ion tail in a two-minute exposure at 1:43 p.m. EDT (17:43 GMT) with the Virtual Telescope Project in Italy. The image showed an ionized-gas afterglow and a fan-like sensor artifact; Masi said the trail was atmospheric while the comet lay about 100 million kilometers away. He released a 1:37–2:12 p.m. timelapse with satellite streaks. Comet Lemmon brightened to magnitude +4.2 and was visible with 10x50 binoculars.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SHARKS CONFIRM GEOMETRIC SCALING</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“If this holds true in other animal groups, it probably reflects underlying rules of heat exchange, metabolism or development that constrain evolution.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers used CT scans and digital tools to create 3D models of more than 50 shark species and found that sharks’ surface area scaled with body mass roughly to the two‑thirds power. Led by Joel Gayford and published in Royal Society Open Science, the study provided strong empirical support for geometric scaling in a diverse vertebrate group and suggested underlying constraints such as heat exchange, metabolism or development. The authors noted that earlier surface‑area and volume measurements were error‑prone and ethically problematic.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““Several collaborations … are developing next-generation detectors with the goal of accessing lower dark matter masses with unprecedented sensitivity,””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">While searches for heavy WIMPs had failed, researchers shifted to lighter WIMP-type particles. A Max Planck Institute team proposed using sucrose—plain sugar crystals—in the SWEET project because each molecule contained 22 hydrogen atoms, which increased the chance of collisions with light dark matter compared with purer or more exotic materials. They focused on differing nucleus sizes in carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and posted their study to arXiv pending peer review.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">YAWNING COOLS THE BRAIN</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;most people suggest that it has to do with breathing or respiration&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Yawning occurred across vertebrates and its purpose remained contested. Experiments in the 1980s that manipulated inhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide did not alter yawning frequency, refuting the idea that yawning increased blood oxygen. Andrew Gallup's research proposed that jaw gaping changed cranial circulation—raising arterial supply and venous return—and that deep inhalation cooled the brain via evaporation and convection. Yawn frequency varied with ambient temperature and increased in some conditions or treatments that elevated brain or body temperature.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It was the 17th flight for this particular booster.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched 28 Starlink satellites on Oct. 27, lifting a Falcon 9 from Vandenberg Space Force Base at 8:43 p.m. EDT (5:43 p.m. PT; 0043 GMT Oct. 28). Booster 1082 returned and landed on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You after its 17th flight; the upper stage continued to deploy the satellites to LEO about an hour later. The launch was the 137th Falcon 9 mission of the year (third in three days), extending SpaceX's single‑year launch record beyond 134 set in 2024.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“satellites are slowly rusting in space.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Satellites in low Earth orbit (95–1,900 km) were corroded by highly reactive atomic oxygen formed when solar ultraviolet split O2, and they experienced gradual drag from atmospheric collisions, typically lasting about five years. A University of Texas at Dallas team led by Rafik Addou developed a protective coating using atomic layer deposition and sol-gel processing to make atomically controlled, smooth protective films. Independent tests showed the coating withstood atomic-oxygen conditions harsher than space, potentially enabling very low Earth orbit operations.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Lux at ORNL was described as the nation’s first dedicated AI Factory for science, energy, and national security.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">AMD sealed a $1 billion deal with the US Department of Energy, Oracle, and HPE to build two AMD‑powered supercomputers, Lux and Discovery, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. Lux was due in early 2026 as an 'AI Factory' to train and deploy foundation models; Discovery, due in 2029, had a 'Bandwidth Everywhere' design to boost performance and energy efficiency versus Frontier. Both built on AMD's work on Frontier and were intended to support energy, biology, materials, national security, and manufacturing research.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we can only see to the point when the cosmos was already 380,000 years old”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers described the cosmic microwave background as a barrier that limited direct observation to when the Universe was about 380,000 years old. Two papers proposed indirect probes beyond that wall: soft X-ray peaks from electron–positron cascades produced by early density-triggered bursts that could seed supermassive black holes, and high-energy neutrino peaks from bursts that escaped earlier. The neutrino signal was promising but was currently limited by the inability of detectors to resolve the cosmic neutrino background.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“to extract accurate astrometry”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A newly found interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), posed no threat to Earth and was the third known interstellar object. The International Asteroid Warning Network, coordinated with NASA and announced by the Minor Planet Center on Oct. 21, organized an observing campaign to practice astrometry and orbit prediction before the comet was to leave between Nov. 27, 2025 and Jan. 27, 2026. Its closest approach was about 1.8 AU; citizen scientists could register by Nov. 7 for workshops and teleconferences.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the search for biopigments as signs of life in clouds.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A submitted manuscript reported laboratory spectroscopy of seven aerial microbial strains from Earth's atmosphere (Modestobacter versicolor, Roseomonas vinacea, Micrococcus luteus, Massilia niabensis, Noviherbaspirillum soli, Curtobacterium aetherium, Curtobacterium oceanosedimentum) and found distinct UV-protective biopigment reflectance signatures. The authors argued these biosignatures could enable detection of airborne life in exoplanet clouds, cited Sagan and Salpeter's 1976 cloud-life types, and discussed detectability by future missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory and current JWST observations.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This project represents the single largest amount of telescope time for a molecular line survey...&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers studied the Taurus Molecular Cloud‑1 (TMC‑1) and, from more than 1,400 hours of Green Bank Telescope observations published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, censused 102 molecules — more than in any other known interstellar cloud. Most species were hydrocarbons and nitrogen‑rich compounds; ten aromatic (ring‑shaped) molecules were detected. The team built automated analysis tools, used advanced statistics to determine abundances including isotopologues, and released the fully calibrated, reduced dataset publicly.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It is the final view of the satellite before launch.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Copernicus Sentinel-1D satellite had been encapsulated inside the Ariane 6 fairing at Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana. Encapsulation placed the satellite inside the rocket's protective nose cone and represented the final view before a launch scheduled for Tuesday, 4 November at 22:03 CET. The Sentinel-1 mission provided all‑weather, day‑and‑night high‑resolution radar imagery for Copernicus, supporting disaster response teams, environmental agencies, maritime authorities and climate scientists who relied on frequent critical data updates.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Large language models are very crude representations of the brain.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An AI journalist described visiting Conscium, a 2024 startup founded by Daniel Hulme with advisers from neuroscience, philosophy, and animal-consciousness research that aimed to detect, measure and build consciousness. Hulme remained skeptical about LLMs’ interiority, noting biological animals showed interactions chatbots lacked. Conscium planned to decompose consciousness into sensing, self-awareness and metacognition and catalyze those components. Adviser Mark Solms, building on Friston’s free-energy ideas, argued emotions from predictive feedback loops produced sentience and said he’d run a lab test.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It's all thanks to JWST’s exceptional sensitivity, combined with high angular resolution.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A team led by Marta Sewiło at NASA Goddard used JWST’s MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph to detect five complex organic molecules in ices around protostar ST6 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Identified species included acetaldehyde, acetic acid, ethanol and methyl formate; ethanol, methyl formate and acetaldehyde were first detections in a neighboring galaxy, and acetic acid was the first conclusive ice detection in protoplanetary systems. The LMC’s lower heavy-element content and higher UV made the result notable.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This makes TOI-2267 the first binary system known to host transiting planets around both of its stars.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using NASA's TESS, astronomers discovered three Earth-size planets in the TOI-2267 system about 190 light-years away. The compact binary hosted two planets transiting one star and a third transiting the companion, making TOI-2267 the first binary known to host transiting planets around both stars. The finding contradicted expectations that close binaries precluded planet formation and broke records as the most compact and coldest stellar pair with known planets. The team used SHERLOCK on TESS data and followed up with SPECULOOS and TRAPPIST observations.</p>

  <p class="dek">Hidden in a lab in north-west London, three black metal robotic hands moved on an engineering workbench as Rich Walker, director of Shadow Robot, described an ambition to build a general-purpose servant that could do housework. The firm framed robots as a response to the UK social-care crisis: a reported 131,000 vacancies for adult care workers, around two million people aged 65+ with unmet care needs, and projections that one in four people would be 65+ by 2050. The previous government had invested £34m in care-robot development.</p>
