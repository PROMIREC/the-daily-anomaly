  <blockquote class="quote">“This suggests that the strong outflows reported in the literature for planets orbiting early-type stars are not representative of all early-type systems.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A study submitted to The Astronomical Journal conducted the first survey of atmospheric escape on six gas giants orbiting F-type stars, analyzing ten transits with the WIRC instrument at Palomar. WASP-12 b and WASP-180 A b showed significant escape, WASP-93 b and HAT-P-8 b showed potential escape, and WASP-103 b and KELT-7 b showed none. Estimated mass-loss rates for WASP-12 b and WASP-180 A b were about 10^12.4 and 10^11.85 g/s; results aligned broadly with models and some prior measurements.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Water, as a refrigerant, can hold huge amounts of heat.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Jonathan Paul recorded up to 42°C in a London Tube station and argued tunnels in clay retained heat, while air-conditioning on trains risked warming tunnels further. He proposed using ~10°C groundwater as a refrigerant via heat exchangers above platforms, tested a prototype in a chalk quarry near Reading, and reported a 10–11°C drop in a bedroom-sized gallery over an hour. He had published a 2022 paper, noted filters to limit limescale, and said larger-room tests and Transport for London approval remained uncertain.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BOWHEAD SECRETS COULD SLOW AGING</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“maybe part of the mechanism is through very accurate and efficient repair of DNA breaks.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers found that bowhead whales, which lived more than 200 years, repaired DNA double-strand breaks particularly efficiently and so acquired fewer mutations. Experiments showed the cold-induced protein CIRBP, produced about 100 times more in bowheads than humans, enhanced repair. Increasing CIRBP in human cells doubled double-strand-break repair, and extra CIRBP extended flies' lifespan and radiation resilience. The findings, published in Nature, prompted plans to explore applying the mechanism to improve human healthy ageing and tissue protection.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Fires are part of our life [now] in the mountains, and we have to be prepared for them.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A popular ski town, Vail, Colorado, adopted Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s new smart city AI solution (developed with Kamiwaza, Nvidia and others) to speed wildfire detection and improve services. The system analyzed existing bus- and mountain-mounted camera footage, restored image fidelity, and detected smoke and lightning in real time; Kamiwaza added weather context and risk cues. The collaboration began after a nearby July fire; officials had previously relied on people to interpret footage.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the first stars in the early Universe formed in binary systems”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A study led by Tomer Shenar (Tel Aviv University) with Hugues Sana and Julia Bodensteiner, published in Nature Astronomy, reported that the Universe's first stars (Population III) formed as binary systems. The conclusion came from the BLOeM survey, a two-year international campaign using the VLT to obtain spectra of about 1,000 stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The team argued binaries affected early supernovae, metal enrichment and seeds of supermassive black holes, while Webb had observed early galaxies but could not resolve individual systems.</p>

  <p class="dek">Adobe demoed Corrective AI at its MAX Sneaks showcase in Los Angeles, which allowed editors to change a voice-over's emotion by editing a transcript and selecting preset emotions. The company also demonstrated Project Clean Take, which separated audio into up to five tracks to remove noises or replace licensed music with Adobe Stock versions. Additional generative tools analyzed video to add AI-generated, commercially safe sound effects, though some effects were unrealistic. Adobe had covered part of the reporter's travel.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BRAIN FLUSHES DURING WAKEFUL LAPSES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““The moment somebody’s attention fails is the moment this wave of fluid starts to pulse.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at MIT scanned 26 volunteers with EEG and fMRI after normal sleep and after total sleep deprivation, and found that attention lapses during tests coincided with a wave of cerebrospinal fluid being expelled from the brain and returning after the lapse. Pupils constricted about 12 seconds before the fluid left, and breathing and heart rate fell. Sleep-deprived participants responded more slowly or missed cues. The team reported the results in Nature Neuroscience.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An MIT study revealed that momentary attention lapses after sleep loss were accompanied by waves of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flowing out of the brain — a sleep-associated cleansing process that removed daytime waste. Researchers found that sleep deprivation prompted pulses of CSF during wakefulness, which coincided with dramatic attentional impairments. The Nature Neuroscience paper, led by Zinong Yang with senior author Laura Lewis, tested 26 volunteers once sleep-deprived and once well-rested.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Our results show that several fundamental physical properties—evolution time, phases of matter, and causal structure— are probably hard to learn through conventional quantum…”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Popular Mechanics reported that researchers examined intrinsic computational limits of quantum computers. Although quantum machines exploited qubit superposition to speed some algorithms, they were extremely susceptible to decoherence and required heavy error correction; contemporary devices barely exceeded 1,000 qubits and estimates suggested about 20 million qubits would be needed to break classical cryptography. A new arXiv study, following Schuster’s Science paper on randomness, found some problems—like learning certain quantum phases—would have required impossibly long runtimes, possibly billions of trillions of years.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“When an earthquake strikes, every minute counts.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Four teams—TelePIX (Republic of Korea), Datalayer (Belgium), DisasterM3 (Japan) and Thales Services Numériques (France)—were recognised after a global AI competition organised by ESA and the International Charter. The 'AI for Earthquake Response Challenge' run by ESA Φ‑lab brought 143 participants from 40 countries who trained models on more than 200 high‑resolution images of five earthquakes to distinguish damaged from undamaged buildings; winners were honoured at the Charter’s 54th Board Meeting in Strasbourg as CNES assumed six‑month leadership.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“they share an underlying technological similarity in the way stone tools were produced.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that 20,000-year-old bifacial projectile points from early American sites closely resembled Late Upper Paleolithic stone tools from Hokkaido and the PSHK region, leading Loren Davis to argue for a coastal seafaring route from Japan to the Americas. The tools predated Clovis, were smaller and lighter, and were made while the inland Beringian corridor was impassable during the Last Glacial Maximum. Davis was skeptical of the Beringian Standstill Hypothesis due to limited supporting sites.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““This is the next major step in miniaturizing deep-tissue implants.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the MIT Media Lab developed an injectable, 200‑micrometer antenna — about the size of a grain of sand — to wirelessly power deep‑tissue implants such as pacemakers and neuromodulators. Published in IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, the device operated at low frequency (109 kHz) by laminating a magnetostrictive film with a piezoelectric film so magnetic‑field‑induced strain produced electric charge. It delivered four to five orders of magnitude more power than similar‑size metallic‑coil GHz antennas and enabled needle placement instead of surgery.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“you can actually burn things to make things”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Sili Deng, Doherty Chair in Ocean Utilization and associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, led research to shift dependence on fossil fuels toward renewable energy with storage. Her group investigated combustion fundamentals and emissions, alternative fuels and metal combustion, and flame-based materials for catalysis and battery energy storage. They developed flame-assisted spray pyrolysis (FASP) to reduce lithium‑ion cathode manufacturing costs and studied aluminum combustion as an alternative fuel. Deng received the 2025 Hiroshi Tsuji Early Career Researcher Award.</p>

  <p class="dek">In the 1950s, photographic plates from Palomar Observatory were reanalyzed by VASCO researchers led by Beatriz Villarroel and Stephen Bruehl, who studied 106,000 transients from 1951–1957. They reported statistical correlations between brief flashes and UAP reports and atmospheric nuclear tests—flashes were 68% more likely the day after a test and rose 8.5% per UAP report—and speculated some were reflective objects in high Earth orbit.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;the need to have a systematic approach for how the basic science on how children learn to read is translated into educational opportunity.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers found that kindergarten reading screenings required in most states may not have worked as intended in many schools. A survey of about 250 teachers reported many lacked adequate training to perform the tests and about half were not confident that children needing extra reading instruction received it. The authors said screens could be essential when successful but many districts may need to change how they implemented and analyzed screenings. The open-access study appeared in Annals of Dyslexia.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“There is no objective reality, according to Rovelli — only perspectives.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist affiliated with Aix‑Marseille University, argued that there was no objective reality, only perspectives, illustrating this with a pigeon’s head‑bob. He helped develop loop quantum gravity, later proposed a relational interpretation of quantum mechanics, and became a bestselling popular‑science author (Seven Brief Lessons on Physics sold over two million copies). His 1977 activism and continued political engagement informed his readiness to challenge traditional intuitions in foundational physics.</p>

  <p class="dek">Iain Boyd, a professor of aerospace engineering, described Russia's Oct. 26, 2025 claim that it had successfully tested a nuclear-powered missile, Burevestnik, over the Arctic after years of development and earlier flights — one earlier test had killed five nuclear scientists. He explained how such weapons worked, the advantages over conventional missiles, and their potential to disrupt global strategic stability, and provided background on missile types, roles, ranges and operational platforms.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Dark matter and black holes play critical—and often overlapping—roles in galactic dynamics.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers studied Segue 1, a tiny Milky Way satellite about 75,000 light-years away, with ~600,000 solar masses but luminosity comparable to ~300 Suns, yielding a high mass-to-light ratio previously attributed to dark matter. New modeling published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, led by Nathaniel Lujan, showed that a central massive black hole could instead explain Segue 1's dynamics; the team used stellar motions to disentangle black-hole and dark-matter influences. The study arose from a joint UT Austin–UT San Antonio course.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“All work on Artemis II is excepted to protect both the property and to protect against risks to the crew”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Nearly one month into a federal shutdown, NASA’s critical operations had remained largely unaffected, but many civil servants and contractors were unpaid while continuing essential work. Kennedy Space Center crews completed stacking Orion atop the SLS for Artemis II, the first crewed Orion/SLS flight that would test the capsule during a 10-day mission around the Moon. NASA said contracts were funded into early November and excepted work was authorized; teams continued despite pay interruptions, though officials warned shutdown inefficiencies could delay Artemis II.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Henon, on the other hand, will be able to independently communicate with ground stations through ESA’s Estrack network.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">ESA’s Henon mission was described as the first stand-alone CubeSat to independently travel into deep space, communicate with Earth and manoeuvre without a larger carrier. It was planned to reach an orbit up to 24 million km from Earth, beyond the 2 million km deep-space boundary. Henon used a miniaturised deep-space transponder to contact ESA Estrack and a bespoke xenon ion engine powered by solar panels. Argotec entered final implementation; the design passed its Critical Design Review and FlatSat testing was next.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“If you put those together, you can get a 3D map of the temperatures in this atmosphere.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers produced the first 3D map of exoplanet WASP-18b using JWST and a new eclipse-mapping technique that tracked wavelength-dependent light as the planet moved behind its star. They reconstructed temperatures in 3D, finding a bright central dayside hotspot surrounded by a cooler ring, showing poor heat redistribution on the tidally locked planet. The hotspot had reduced water vapor consistent with thermal breakdown at about 2,760°C. WASP-18b was ~400 light-years away, ~10 Jupiter masses, with a 23-hour orbit; results appeared in Nature Astronomy (Oct 28, 2025).</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Chondrites are like time capsules from the dawn of the solar system.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Rice University researchers Baibhav Srivastava and André Izidoro found that Jupiter’s rapid early growth carved rings and gaps in the protoplanetary disk, causing gas and dust to collect and preventing particles from spiraling into the Sun. That produced a second generation of planetesimals 2–3 million years after the first solids, explaining late-forming chondritic meteorites. Jupiter also blocked inward migration of material and young planets, preserving isotopic separation and stabilizing orbits near 1 AU, shaping Earth’s formation.</p>

  <p class="dek">Japan's JAXA declared the Akatsuki Venus orbiter dead on Oct. 28 after losing contact May 29, 2024 following a month of communications problems. Launched in 2010 for about $300 million, the probe missed its initial orbital insertion when its main engine failed, then used attitude-control thrusters to enter Venus orbit in 2015. Akatsuki persisted nearly a decade, tripled its 4.5-year design life, produced 178 journal papers and studied Venusian cloud-level winds and climate.</p>

Uber announced plans to deploy at least 20,000 Lucid cars using Nuro's driving software and invested in both companies. The service was to use Lucid Gravity SUVs with Nuro Level 4 autonomy, available only through Uber's app; an Engineering Test Fleet of over 100 robotaxis would run safety tests, with Nuro leading safety validation. The service was to be fully owned and operated by Uber.</p>

  <p class="dek">Iceland had finally been found to host mosquitoes after insect enthusiast Björn Hjaltason reported three Culiseta annulata (two female, one male) in mid‑October, and the Natural Science Institute of Iceland confirmed the finding. The insects likely arrived via freight shipping; unlike some Arctic species, C. annulata could overwinter in buildings. Iceland had experienced record heat that year, and with warming climates enabling mosquito spread (which killed roughly 700,000 people annually from disease), Antarctica became the only mosquito‑free landmass.</p>

  <p class="dek">A report published Oct. 29 in BioScience, led by Oregon State University researchers, said 2024 may have been Earth’s hottest year in at least 125,000 years and capped a decade of record heat. The study found 22 of 34 measurable Earth-health indicators reached record extremes, greenhouse gases remained at record levels into 2025 (CO2 surpassed 430 ppm at Mauna Loa), and cited fewer reflective aerosols, thinner clouds and falling albedo as drivers; it reported record ocean heat, major ice loss, high tree-cover loss and surging fire damage.</p>
