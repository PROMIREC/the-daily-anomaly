  <blockquote class="quote">“The primary goal on the flight test is to measure the real-world vehicle dynamics as engines shut down while transitioning between the different phases.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched the 11th full-scale Starship test flight from South Texas, aiming for a roughly one-hour trajectory to the Indian Ocean. Liftoff occurred within a 75-minute window after loading more than 10.5 million pounds of methane and oxygen; the 33 Raptor engines produced about 16.7 million pounds of thrust. A previously flown Super Heavy booster separated after ~2.5 minutes, tested a new 13-5-3 landing-burn sequence and splashed down; Starship deployed eight Starlink simulators, restarted a Raptor, and tested its heat shield.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain’s vasculature.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A nanoparticle drug triggered the blood-brain barrier in Alzheimer’s model mice to traffic toxic amyloid‑beta out of the brain into the bloodstream, where it was rapidly destroyed. Three injections halved amyloid‑beta within an hour and improved spatial memory, with effects lasting six months. Authors reported the nanoparticles acted as a drug that restored vascular clearance pathways. More study was needed to determine whether the approach would work in humans.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“bifurcating current sheet”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">University of Michigan–led researchers published in The Astrophysical Journal simulated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and found that encounters with corotating interaction regions (CIRs) fragmented CMEs, matching observations. The simulation described four steps: a CME formed a cusp on hitting a slower, denser CIR; trailing plasma constricted it into a neck, isolating the front and creating a bifurcating current sheet that stored energy; that sheet broke, released the energy, and formed smaller flux ropes. They urged upgrades to sensors and models.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“game changer”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Psychologists at the University of Sussex filmed volunteers with thermal cameras during a controlled stress test that involved an unexpected five-minute speech and counting backwards in intervals of 17 before a panel. Stress altered facial blood flow and the nose temperature dropped (appearing blue on thermal images). In 29 volunteers the nose temperature fell by three to six degrees. Researchers said thermal imaging could be a potential &quot;game changer&quot; for measuring stress and recovery.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“could transform treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at University College London and Oxford University developed a non‑invasive ultrasound helmet, reported in Nature Communications, that used transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) with 256 tubular probes and a plastic face mask to focus &gt;20 kHz pulses on deep brain targets about 1,000 times smaller than prior ultrasound. fMRI tests targeting the lateral geniculate nucleus altered visual cortex activity, and the team planned further trials on Parkinson’s-related regions, hoping clinical use—possibly as an alternative to deep brain stimulation—within a decade.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the first of a new generation of satellites”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Rocket Lab launched an Electron from Rocket Lab's New Zealand site on mission &quot;Owl New World&quot; carrying Synspective's Strix radar satellite. Liftoff was scheduled Oct. 14 at 12:30 p.m. EDT (1630 GMT; 5:30 a.m. Oct. 15 NZT); Rocket Lab streamed live 30 minutes before, and Space.com simulcast. The Strix craft, described as the first of a new generation for Synspective's LEO constellation, was to deploy 362 miles (583 km) up 50 minutes after launch; six Strix had reached orbit and 20 more launches remained.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SIMPLEX SPEED SECRET FINALLY REVEALED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;It has always run fast, and nobody’s seen it not be fast.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Quanta reported that George Dantzig had famously solved two open statistics problems and later invented the simplex method for optimization while advising the U.S. Air Force. The simplex remained widely used and fast in practice despite 1972 proofs of potential exponential worst-case time. Sophie Huiberts and Eleon Bach presented a December FOCS paper that sped up the algorithm and explained why worst-case runtimes did not appear, building on Spielman and Teng (2001) and earning praise from peers.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Let 'em hear it, Starbase!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX's Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, completed a successful suborbital test flight on Oct. 13 from Starbase in South Texas — its 11th test and second consecutive success after late August. The launch was the final flight of the current Starship before a larger variant replaced it; employees cheered and spokesperson Dan Huot said, &quot;Let 'em hear it, Starbase!&quot; Starship was developed for Mars and was selected as NASA's Artemis crewed lander for the 2027 Artemis 3 lunar south-pole mission. Musk attended.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“That was absolutely awesome.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX closed a development chapter with a successful 11th Starship test flight on Oct. 13 at 6:23 p.m. CT (11:23 p.m. UTC), the last liftoff from that South Texas pad. The reused Super Heavy fired all 33 Raptor engines, relit engines for a landing burn (12 of 13 relights) and splashed down in the Gulf. Ship deployed eight flat spacecraft, relit one of six Raptors, and the test checked procedures and performance for Starship V3, with Pad 2 and V3 planned next year.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“a biogeochemical bottleneck”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Great Oxidation Event, between 2.1 and 2.4 billion years ago, had been delayed despite earlier cyanobacterial evolution. Okayama University researchers led by Dr. Dilan Ratnayake tested whether urea formed abiotically and how urea and nickel affected Synechococcus growth. They showed urea formed from ammonium, cyanide and iron under intense UV, and that high urea and nickel concentrations inhibited cyanobacterial blooms; nickel enabled urease yet promoted urea formation, creating a biogeochemical bottleneck that kept populations sparse until concentrations fell and oxygenation rose.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“interplanetary coronal mass ejections (CMEs) traveled at about 1,800 miles per second”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article reported that “space tornadoes,” spun off from solar ejections, could have caused geomagnetic storms but were not easy to study. It said space-weather forecasting required simulating the Sun, planets and interplanetary space within a single “simulation box.” The piece noted the Sun expelled charged particles and magnetic fields, and that the most powerful events—interplanetary coronal mass ejections (CMEs)—traveled at about 1,800 miles per second, moving vast masses almost instantaneously.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“For the low-orbit satellites we expect a 5-year replacement cycle, and that translates to 5 reentries a day.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Popular Mechanics reported that SpaceX’s Starlink network was already producing one to two de-orbits per day, potentially rising to five daily reentries once operators reached about 30,000 satellites, with China possibly adding 20,000 more. Smithsonian astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell tracked launches and reentries and warned of rising counts and a five-year replacement cycle. Short satellite lifespans, solar-driven atmospheric drag, malfunctions, and metal pollution in the stratosphere raised concerns about Kessler syndrome and possible ozone-impacting chemistry as Starlink scaled up.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ORBITAL COLLISION RISK SOARS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Operators didn't want to be spending all their time worrying about collision avoidance.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A new study found that satellites forced to perform more than ten collision-avoidance maneuvers per month rose from 0.2% in 2019 to 1.4% by early 2025—about 340 satellites. The number of objects in low Earth orbit climbed from ~13,700 in 2019 to 24,185 in 2025 (a 76% increase), and projections showed up to 70,000 satellites by decade's end. Researchers used the U.S. Space Command catalog, flagged approaches within 66 ft (200 m), and noted varied operator risk thresholds.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This is a really stable and multifunctional tool.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT engineers designed a control mechanism that established and later edited set points for protein expression of synthetic gene circuits delivered into cells, addressing difficulties in achieving correct protein amounts. They induced consistent target protein levels and converted mouse embryonic fibroblasts into motor neurons by delivering high levels of a conversion-promoting gene. The study, led by Katie Galloway with lead author Sneha Kabaria, appeared in Nature Biotechnology.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“embed what it’s learned from developing frontier models and products directly into the hardware”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">OpenAI partnered with Broadcom to design its own chips for AI data centers, aiming to reduce reliance on Nvidia and to deploy &quot;10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators.&quot; Broadcom planned rack deployments in the second half of 2026 with the deal due to finish by the end of 2029. The announcement followed OpenAI’s six-gigawatt deal with AMD and a 10-gigawatt deal with Nvidia, was enabled by changes to its Microsoft exclusivity, and reflected an industry shift toward custom AI hardware.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“capable of briefly turning night to day”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Space.com reported that the Southern and Northern Taurid meteor streams were active and could spawn dramatic fireballs in the weeks before their November peaks. Both radiants appeared in Taurus and shared parent comet 2P/Encke, which shed debris on its 3.3-year orbit. The Northern Taurids became active Oct. 20 (peaked Nov. 11–12); the Southern had been active since Sept. 20 (peaked Nov. 4–5). Peaks produced up to about 5 meteors per hour and occasional bright fireballs.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the next step on our journey.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Microsoft announced MAI-Image-1, its first in-house text-to-image generator, and called it &quot;the next step on our journey.&quot; The company said it had solicited feedback from creative professionals to avoid repetitive or generically-stylized outputs, claimed the model &quot;excels&quot; at photorealistic imagery and produced images faster than larger models, and reported it reached the top 10 on LMArena. It joined MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-1-preview; independent safety testing had not yet occurred.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““three-legged pirates … can run just as fast, maintain healthy body weight, reproduce successfully and live surprisingly long lives.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Two lizard biologists recounted that a chance capture of a Bahamian brown anole missing a hind leg prompted a global collaboration with over 60 colleagues. They documented 122 cases of limb loss across 58 lizard species and reported that these “three-legged” survivors ran as fast as intact lizards, maintained healthy body weight, reproduced successfully and lived surprisingly long lives, challenging assumptions about evolutionary consequences of traumatic limb loss.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;learning to see past a restless sheer curtain&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Ground-based telescopes were limited by atmospheric turbulence that blurred images; Johns Hopkins researchers led by Tamás Budavári developed ImageMM, an algorithm using Majorization-Minimization to model light through shifting atmospheric layers. Tests on Subaru Telescope data processed blurry, noisy images in seconds, revealing spiral galaxy structure, removed noise and handled missing pixels, and improved detection of fainter, more distant objects. The method was expected to benefit surveys like the Rubin Observatory's studies of dark energy and dark matter.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“It was an exciting moment when the blood-red colour appeared in the dish.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists had grown embryo-like structures from human stem cells in the laboratory that produced human blood cells. The model, created without eggs or sperm, mimicked natural self-organising development and was used to study early heart and blood formation. Researchers said the advance could enable generation of patient-compatible blood stem cells for bone marrow transplants, drug screening and modelling disorders such as leukaemia, but it remained at an early stage.</p>
