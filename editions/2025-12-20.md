  <blockquote class="quote">“magnetic 'tadpoles'”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Parker Solar Probe’s December 2024 perihelion, about 4 million miles from the Sun and inside its atmosphere, allowed its Wide-Field imagers to capture magnetic activity up close. Researchers reported three discoveries: dark magnetic “tadpoles” (inflow swarms) returning toward the Sun, some only detectable by Parker and about twice Earth’s diameter; tearing of the Heliospheric Current Sheet via a tearing‑mode instability, producing an expanding tadpole that grew rapidly; and the pinching and separation of a magnetic structure into in/out pairs, one ejected at ~560 km/s.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A multinational team investigated whether the trade-off between quality and quantity shaped ant evolution, finding that as colonies became larger and more complex they produced smaller, cheaper workers with reduced exoskeleton investment. They analyzed Antscan 3D micro-CT imagery of over 880 specimens from more than 500 species and used an unsupervised segmentation algorithm to measure cuticle volumes (6–35% of body volume). Evolutionary models attributed 12% of cuticle variation to temperature and 37% to dietary nitrogen.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This has been one of the most surprising and exciting photos I've ever taken.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On Nov. 26 over northern Italy, photographer Valter Binotto in Possagno captured an image showing an elve and a sprite simultaneously. Both were Transient Luminous Events: elves were described as vast ghostly red rings up to 300 miles across caused by lightning-driven electromagnetic pulses in the ionosphere and lasting under a millisecond; sprites resembled crimson jellyfish or branching tendrils above storms. Binotto recorded the frame from 25 fps video with a Sony A7S and 50mm f/1.4; it was his third elve photograph.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Betelgeuse may not explode soon after all, or it might explode tomorrow!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Betelgeuse dimmed in 2019, prompting speculation it might soon explode as a supernova, but astronomers concluded it likely would not explode immediately. The red supergiant, about 642 light‑years away and between Mars and Jupiter in diameter, had exhausted core hydrogen and burned helium; it was a variable, evolving, possibly 'runaway' star that may have merged with a companion and could have millions of years left. The nearby Crab Nebula was the remnant of the 1054 supernova, containing expanding heavy‑element clouds and a spinning neutron star.</p>

  <p class="dek">Article explained Earth time standards (UTC, TAI) and examined Martian timekeeping. It noted a Martian sol was about 37 minutes and 23 seconds longer than an Earth day and mentioned the Darian calendar and mission practice of counting sols and using Airy Mean Time. A study found relativistic effects — lower Martian gravity sped clocks by ~477 microseconds/day, orbital motion added ~226 microseconds, and light-time delays varied — and concluded synchronization with Earth was feasible but left ~100 ns/day residuals.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“With these new satellites, we strengthen Europe’s global navigation services - delivering greater precision, reliability and autonomy in space”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On 17 December 2025, two Galileo satellites (SAT 33 and SAT 34) launched from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana on flight VA266, the first Ariane 6 Galileo launch and the programme’s 14th operational launch. The satellites separated after just under four hours; acquisition of signal and deployment of solar arrays confirmed both were healthy and the launch was declared successful. ESA and Arianespace conducted the launch for the European Commission; OHB manufactured the satellites and EUSPA brought them into service and oversaw their operation.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BRIGHT BLUE BLASTS FROM BLACK HOLES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It's definitely not just an exploding star.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">AT 2024wpp, a 2024 Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT), suggested LFBOTs resulted from extreme tidal disruption events (TDEs) in which black holes up to about 100 solar masses shredded companion stars in days. About a dozen LFBOTs were found over a decade and were previously ascribed to supernovas or black-hole accretion. AT 2024wpp emitted roughly 100 times the energy of a supernova, showed a near-infrared excess like AT 2018cow, and was observed with Gemini South; why only some TDEs made LFBOTs remained unclear.</p>

  <p class="dek">Astronomers reported that LIGO and Virgo had detected a gravitational-wave signal on Aug. 18, 2025, designated AT2025ulz, which they suggested was the first known &quot;superkilonova.&quot; The Zwicky Transient Facility found a rapidly fading red source 1.3 billion light-years away. Initially the eruption resembled the 2017 kilonova GW170817, then looked more like a supernova; follow-up observations (Keck, Fraunhofer) showed a rapid fade and red glow from heavy-element opacity, consistent with a kilonova obscured by a supernova.</p>

  <p class="dek">Congress passed and President Trump signed the FY2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which included energy provisions aimed at advancing next‑generation nuclear reactors. The bill established the International Nuclear Energy Act to create working groups, boost funding and interagency cooperation to develop and export US nuclear technologies, reauthorized the US International Development Finance Corporation to invest in nuclear and uranium fuel projects, and directed the Department of Defense to create an executive agent for installation and operational nuclear energy. Advocates called these measures “big wins.”</p>

  <p class="dek">Earth from Space featured a wintery false‑colour Sentinel‑2 image of Quebec’s Manicouagan crater, a circular structure formed by a 5 km asteroid impact 214 million years ago. The annular reservoir with René‑Levasseur Island at its centre lay 700 km northeast of Quebec City and had been created in the 1960s for hydroelectricity. Snow appeared white, frozen water blue, and vegetation red; the site was a UNESCO biosphere reserve. Sentinel‑2 provided 10 m resolution across 13 bands.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We interpret both cs1 and cs2 as evidence of a collisional process in the Fomalhaut planetary system.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers reported that Hubble observations and a new Science paper (lead author Paul Kalas) had identified two transient dust clumps, cs1 and cs2, in the Fomalhaut A debris belt and interpreted them as debris from planetesimal collisions. Fomalhaut A was a young (~400 million years), luminous primary in a triple-star system. Fomalhaut b had earlier been reclassified as a collision-generated dust cloud; cs2 was detected in 2023 while cs1 had dissipated.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“There are targeted projections for targeted impact.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT neuroscientists found that two prefrontal subregions—the orbitofrontal cortex (ORB) and anterior cingulate area (ACA)—sent tailored signals to primary visual (VISp) and motor (MOp) cortices. Using anatomical tracing and axonal recordings while mice ran, viewed images/movies, and experienced arousal manipulations, they showed ACA increased visual sharpening with arousal and was contrast-sensitive, while ORB reduced visual sharpness only at high arousal. ACA targeted VISp layer 6, ORB targeted layer 5; both conveyed motion and arousal information to downstream areas.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The anomaly led to venting of the propulsion tank”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX said one of its Starlink satellites experienced an anomaly likely caused by a small explosion that vented the propulsion tank, producing a rapid ~4 km semi-major axis decay and releasing a small number of trackable, low-relative-velocity objects. LeoLabs attributed the event to an internal energetic source rather than a collision. SpaceX said the satellite was largely intact, tumbling, would reenter and fully demise within weeks, posed no ISS risk, and that it was working with NASA and the US Space Force to track remains.</p>

  <p class="dek">A preprint by Vito Saggese et al. predicted the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope would detect many multiplanet systems via microlensing. They simulated 1.3 million synthetic “triple-lens” light curves (one star, two planets). The detection pipeline identified 66.3% overall; efficiency rose to 93% for resonant configurations, fell to 55% when both planets were wide, and reached ~90% when both planets were Jupiter-mass.</p>

As NGC 4388 moved through the cluster's hot intracluster medium, ram pressure stripped disk gas, leaving a trailing cloud. Researchers said ionization was uncertain: radiation from a superheated accretion disk around the central black hole likely ionized nearby gas, while shocks may have ionized distant filaments; new multiwavelength data revealed the cloud.</p>
