  <blockquote class="quote">“Relationships are the key to everything.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Erin Sholl was deputy chief of the Space Transportation Systems Division at NASA Johnson Space Center’s Safety and Mission Assurance Directorate. She overcame early math struggles, switched from chemical to aerospace engineering at Penn State, then joined Johnson as a trajectory operations officer supporting the ISS in Mission Control. She moved into Safety and Mission Assurance, led the Operations and Visiting Vehicles Branch, served as acting deputy chief for Space Habitation Systems, and focused on system safety, strategic planning, mentorship, and creating JSC Parenting.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AI PREDICTS EMBRYO CELL DANCE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“This very initial phase is known as gastrulation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT engineers developed a deep-learning model that predicted minute-by-minute how individual cells folded, divided, and rearranged during a fruit fly embryo’s first hour (gastrulation). The model learned geometric properties (position, cell–cell contacts) from videos of embryos with about 5,000 cells and predicted those cell behaviors with 90% accuracy. The study appeared in Nature Methods. The researchers suggested extending the approach to other species (zebrafish, mice) and to detect early patterns of diseases such as asthma and cancer.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">OMEGA CENTAURI HEART FALLS SILENT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“They found nothing.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Omega Centauri was the Milky Way's largest, brightest globular cluster and earlier Hubble observations had identified seven fast-moving inner stars implying an intermediate-mass black hole of roughly 8,200–47,000 solar masses. Angiraben Mahida et al. used the Australia Telescope Compact Array for ~170 hours at 7.25 GHz, reached 1.1 microjansky sensitivity, and detected no radio emission at proposed centres. Using the fundamental plane, they constrained accretion efficiency to ≲0.004 and suggested a gas-poor, stripped-dwarf-galaxy core explained the silence.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AI PHOTOS DITCH THE GLOSS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“making image quality a little bit worse”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">AI image generators had improved from early tiny, artifact‑prone outputs (extra fingers, fuzzy details) through DALL·E, DALL·E 2 and models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, but a newer trend deliberately injected real‑world imperfections to increase realism. Google’s 2025 Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro were cited for preserving likeness and mimicking phone‑camera flaws (contrast, sharpening, exposure), and developers had reduced the glossy, stylized look to make images read as authentic photos.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">DARPA LAUNCHES CRYSTAL PALACE REVOLUTION</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“limited to global parameter control, such as adjusting temperature, pressure, and flow rate”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">DARPA’s Microsystems Technology Office launched 'Crystal Palace' in early December to revolutionize production of single-crystal inorganic materials for next-generation microsystems. It argued existing growth tools relied on coarse, global controls that mismatched nanoscale growth physics, causing defects and scale-up failures as materials became more complex. The program sought new, local and generalizable methods to control material formation at or near atomic scales while achieving wafer-scale uniformity.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STARLINK NEAR MISS WITH CHINESE SATELLITE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;When satellite operators do not share ephemeris for their satellites, dangerously close approaches can occur in space.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Last week a newly deployed Chinese satellite from a nine-satellite deployment from Jiuquan came within about 200 meters of Starlink satellite STARLINK-6079 at 560 km altitude. SpaceX said the other operator had not shared ephemeris data, risking close approaches, while CAS Space said it used ground-based space awareness to select launch windows and noted the incident occurred nearly 48 hours after payload separation. Starlink had performed over 144,000 avoidance maneuvers in early 2025; growing congestion raised Kessler syndrome concerns.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We call this an extrasolar planet, or “exoplanet” for short.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">It stated that after Clyde W. Tombaugh’s Pluto discovery, the next planet found came in 1992 and orbited another star; since then astronomers had cataloged more than 6,000 exoplanets. The piece described exoplanets as very distant (nearest &gt;4 light years) and much fainter than their host stars, and noted telescopes’ limited resolving power (Hubble ~0.05 arcsecond) made direct imaging impractical. It said astronomers therefore used other detection methods and outlined the gravitational physics of orbital motion.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MOON SCARRED BY SPACECRAFT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Lunar Anthropocene”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at the University of Kansas published a Nature Geoscience paper that proposed the 'Lunar Anthropocene,' arguing that more than 100 spacecraft interactions since 1959 had made humans a dominant force altering the Moon. They said impacts included sediment movement, surface disturbance, abandoned hardware, and risks to the exosphere and polar ice from exhaust. They urged mitigation, legal protections, and detailed recording of human impacts with archaeologists and anthropologists.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“29 Starlink broadband internet relay satellites”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX launched 29 Starlink satellites (Group 6-82) from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral at 12:25 a.m. EST (0525 GMT) on Dec. 14, beating forecasts of high winds and cumulus clouds. Falcon 9 reached space about 8 minutes 40 seconds after liftoff; its upper stage was to deploy the satellites about an hour later. The first stage returned and landed on the drone ship A Shortfall of Gravitas, marking booster B1092's ninth flight. It was SpaceX's 163rd Falcon 9 mission in 2025.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MOLTEN WORLD WRAPPED IN GAS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“TOI-561 b is distinct among ultra-short period planets”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using JWST NIRSpec observations, researchers reported the strongest evidence yet for an atmosphere on rocky ultra-short-period super-Earth TOI-561 b, a 1.4‑Earth‑radius planet 275 light‑years away with an &lt;11‑hour orbit. Measurements implied a tidally locked dayside magma ocean beneath a thick gas blanket; a surprisingly low density suggested a small iron core, lighter mantle, or an atmosphere inflating the radius. Researchers led by Johanna Teske published the results in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on Dec. 11.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Amazon Leo, previously known as Project Kuiper,”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">United Launch Alliance (ULA) sent another batch of Amazon's internet satellites to orbit on Dec. 15, launching an Atlas V carrying 27 Amazon Leo spacecraft from Cape Canaveral during a 29-minute window that opened at 3:49 a.m. EST (0849 GMT). Amazon Leo (formerly Project Kuiper) was planned as a roughly 3,200-satellite LEO megaconstellation; six missions had lofted 153 satellites to date (excluding an Oct. 2023 two-prototype test). Atlas V was being phased out for Vulcan Centaur (three missions to date).</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ONE AI MATCHES HUMAN LINGUIST</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“challenges our understanding of what AI can do.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers debated whether large language models could analyze language rather than just use it. Gašper Beguš, Maksymilian Dąbkowski and Ryan Rhodes tested multiple LLMs with four linguistic tasks—including tree-diagram analyses, a made-up-language generalization, and recursion tests designed to avoid memorization. Most models failed to parse rules like humans, but one model performed comparably to a linguistics graduate student, diagramming sentences, resolving ambiguities and handling recursion. Commentators said the results were timely and important.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">RARE INTERSTELLAR COMET THRILLS ASTRONOMERS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“All we get is a fleeting look into the lifetime of these objects.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Darryl Z. Seligman said comet 3I/ATLAS was the third large interstellar visitor discovered and that its Dec. 19 close approach gave astronomers a rare chance to observe reflected light and detect features. The object likely formed in another star’s protoplanetary disk, was ejected by a giant exoplanet, and had traversed the Milky Way for billions of years, probably nearing a star for the first time. Interstellar objects were hyperbolic and brief; earlier examples included 1I/'Oumuamua and CO-rich 2I/Borisov.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">URSID DAWN STORM MAY SURPRISE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;The peak of this meteor display usually occurs during the overnight hours of Dec. 21-22.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The December Ursids were an overlooked meteor shower that typically peaked overnight on Dec. 21–22. Their radiant lay near the star Kochab in Ursa Minor, so they could be seen much of the night with best viewing in the last dark hour before dawn. Rates at maximum were about 5–10 per hour and meteors entered at ~22 mi/s. The shower was poorly observed, had outbursts in 1945 and 1986, was linked to comet 8P/Tuttle, and remained unpredictable; no strong activity was forecast for 2025.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SCIENTISTS MATCH LIGHTS TO EMOTION</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“reliably rated as either happy or sad”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">UC Davis–led researchers ran lab experiments to identify lighting color and tone combinations that maximized the listening experience. They said findings could help artists match live-performance visuals and benefit clinical and home settings. The multi-university team, including lead author Dongwoo (Jason) Yeom, noted anecdotal beliefs about dimmer colors for sad music and brighter colors for happy music. Using an ASU facility, they tested 22 participants with blue, red, cool white and warm white lights while playing songs previously 'reliably rated as either happy or sad.'</p>

  <h3 class="hed">WANDERING GIANTS UPENDED SOLAR ORDER</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;the flyby object had to be relatively low mass, between 3 and 30 Jupiter masses.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers proposed that a close encounter with a wandering substellar object triggered the early giant-planet instability that scattered Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune from a compact resonant chain to their current positions. They ran 3,000 simulations of flybys (1–1000 AU, up to 5 km/s) and found only ~20 (&lt;1%) matched the planets' orbits and preserved the cold classical Kuiper belt; successful encounters required 3–30 Jupiter‑mass objects passing within ≈20 AU.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Hubble tension”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The University of Tokyo team measured the Hubble constant using time delay cosmography, exploiting gravitational lensing of quasars and analysing eight lens systems with data including James Webb. Their value matched the ~73 km/s/Mpc local distance-ladder result rather than the ~67 km/s/Mpc cosmic microwave background prediction, and strengthened the Hubble tension as a real discrepancy. Precision was ~4.5%, and the largest uncertainty was lens galaxy mass profiles; confirming the tension would have required analysing more systems and refining models to reach 1–2%.</p>
