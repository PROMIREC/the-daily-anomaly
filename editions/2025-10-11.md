  <blockquote class="quote">“they always do the same exact thing when they detect weed infestation”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers led by Rhitoban Raychoudhury studied Odontotermes obesus, fungus-farming termites, to see how they dealt with Pseudoxylaria weed infestations. In Petri-dish assays kept in dark incubators with time-lapse imaging, termites—effectively blind but using olfaction and touch—employed varied tactics. For early infestations they typically removed and buried the weed and scraped the comb, containing infection in 94% of samples. The team then tested a harder scenario where one comb was mostly overtaken by weeds.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;the first direct evidence of a growing planet observed within the very ring gap that it's shaping&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Using Magellan and the Large Binocular Telescope, astronomers captured an image of protoplanet WISPIT 2b—a gas giant about five times Jupiter's mass and roughly five million years old—nestled in a ring gap of its star WISPIT 2, 437 light-years away. MagAO‑X detected H‑alpha accretion emission and LBT infrared observations confirmed the source; VLT‑SPHERE had earlier revealed the ringed disk. The image provided the first direct evidence of a growing planet shaping its disk gap.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">AI SPARKS QUAKE DETECTION REVOLUTION</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“it’s kind of like putting on glasses for the first time”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">On January 1, 2008 a magnitude −0.53 quake in Calipatria, California was used as an example of tiny events that recent AI techniques could detect. Over the past seven years, machine-learning tools based on computer imaging had almost completely automated earthquake detection, finding smaller events—especially in noisy urban settings—and replacing human analysts for that task. Scientists called the shift revolutionary but cautioned that many processing tasks and forecasting gains had not yet materialized.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Stay safe while keeping up with the latest typhoon information!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Work continued aboard the ISS but updates were largely halted by the U.S. government shutdown; Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui's social posts were the exception. Yui saw two typhoons from orbit, described their structure, and tested PROX for Japan's HTV‑X cargo vehicle, saying he was assigned to operate the arm to capture it. As of Oct. 10, 2025, seven crew were onboard, multiple crew and cargo spacecraft were docked, and the station had been continuously crewed for 24 years, 11 months and 8 days.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BLACK HOLE TWINS CAUGHT DANCING</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Quasar OJ287 is so bright that it can be detected even by amateur astronomers.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astronomers captured the first radio image showing two supermassive black holes orbiting each other, confirming a decades-old prediction. The pair lay within quasar OJ287 about 5 billion light-years away in Cancer; the quasar had shown a 12-year brightness cycle noted in 1982. Radio observations combined Earth telescopes and the RadioAstron satellite, which yielded about 100,000× sharper views and placed the two black holes where theory predicted.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“when multiple AIs deliberate together, they achieve the highest-ever performance on medical licensing exams”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A study reported that a council of five AI instances (GPT-4) deliberated under a facilitator algorithm and scored up to 97% on US medical licensing exams, outperforming any single model. Published in PLOS Medicine and described in a Johns Hopkins press release, the researchers harnessed LLMs' non-deterministic outputs to reduce hallucinations and improve reliability, suggesting AI collaboration could raise accuracy on high-stakes medical tests.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FLEET PROMISES FORTY PERCENT FASTER WARNINGS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“could speed up &quot;space weather&quot; warnings by 40%”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers proposed a four-spacecraft sentinel fleet called SWIFT that could have sped up space-weather warnings by 40%. Three craft would have used conventional fuel and a fourth would have carried a solar sail about one-third the size of a football field to hold an unusually close, stabilizing orbit for solar observation. Faster alerts for tornado-like plasma structures (CMEs) would have helped protect satellites, power lines and infrastructure. The concept was unfunded and not formally designed; the study appeared in the Oct. 6 Astrophysical Journal and was funded by NASA and the NSF.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">COSMIC MEMORY SOLVES BLACK HOLE MYSTERY</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the universe does not just evolve. It remembers.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers proposed the quantum memory matrix (QMM) and argued information was the universe's most fundamental ingredient. They said spacetime was discrete, made of cells that stored quantum imprints of interactions, so every event left a local change and the cosmos remembered its history. QMM aimed to reconcile relativity and quantum mechanics and resolved the black hole information paradox by encoding information from fallen matter into spacetime cells so it survived black hole evaporation.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">PHYSICS SCULPTS EMBRYO FORM</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The hypothesis is that physics and mechanics can help us understand the biology at the tissue scale.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Quanta Magazine reported that James Thomson’s 1855 explanation of wine “tears” (the Marangoni effect) was analogous to a newly discovered mechanism in embryos: a French biophysics team found that Marangoni-driven surface-tension differences caused a homogeneous cell aggregate to elongate and form a head-to-tail axis. The article said biology had shifted toward recognizing mechanical forces—revealed by modern live imaging—reviving D’Arcy Thompson’s view that physics shaped biological form.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The 2025 Nobel Prize in physics honored John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for their study of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic electrical circuit.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics honored John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis for studying quantum mechanics in a macroscopic electrical circuit. Their institutions in Berkeley, Santa Barbara and New Haven celebrated. The award coincided with the 100th anniversary of quantum mechanics, which had been formulated to explain atomic and subatomic behavior and had enabled applications such as precision measurement, lasers, medical imaging and semiconductors, while experiments remained challenging due to the tiny scale of quantum systems.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">PHOSPHINE FOUND IN BROWN DWARF</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“there was a clear absorption signal centered around 4.3um - right where phosphine is expected.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers used JWST NIRSpec spectra to identify phosphine for the first time in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf, Wolf 1130C, a ~44-times-Jupiter object. A clear absorption feature at 4.3 μm matched phosphine. They explained prior non-detections by metallicity: low-metallicity Wolf 1130C lacked CO2, whose strong absorption usually masked phosphine in warmer brown-dwarf atmospheres. They concluded the phosphine formed in the brown dwarf and rose to its outer atmosphere.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SPACE INDUSTRY DEFIES SHUTDOWN</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;there had been little effect on the space industry.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Edition 8.14 of the Rocket Report noted that more than a week into a federal government shutdown there had been little effect on the space industry. Military space operations continued, NASA prepared Artemis II at Kennedy Space Center for an around-the-Moon launch early next year, the ISS still hosted seven crew, and many space activities were carried out by largely politics-immune commercial firms. Officials warned troops and federal employees would soon miss paychecks unless the shutdown ended.</p>
