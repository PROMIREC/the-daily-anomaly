  <p class="dek">DoorDash brought its robot delivery service to Miami after earlier rollouts in Los Angeles and Chicago with over 600 participating merchants. It worked with Coco Robotics as part of a multi-modal plan to scale human, robot and drone deliveries, and extended robot orders to DashMart and national grocers/retailers. DoorDash Labs led partnerships, had drone pilots with Wing in Charlotte, and introduced an in-house robot, Dot, piloted in Arizona, intended to complement rather than replace staff as autonomous deliveries expanded.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We entered into an energetic solar particle event this morning...&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Intense solar storms on Nov. 11–12 from sunspot group AR4274 produced widespread auroras and an energetic solar particle event. ISS crew rearranged sleeping locations; Russian cosmonauts Oleg Platonov, Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky were instructed to spend a night in the laboratory as a precaution while USOS crew slept in their quarters. Mission control provided locations to avoid; energized particles carried heavy ions that could harm unshielded astronauts.</p>

  <p class="dek">Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket completed its second flight, launching from Cape Canaveral and separating its first-stage booster, which later landed on the sea platform &quot;Jacklyn.&quot; The launch marked the first time the company had caught a New Glenn booster for reuse. The flight ferried NASA satellites for the ESCAPADE Mars mission; a planned November launch was canceled due to weather. Blue Origin had an agreement to launch Amazon's rebranded Leo satellites and could challenge SpaceX if it repeated such successes.</p>

  <p class="dek">The three Shenzhou 20 astronauts returned later than planned and in a different vehicle after their Shenzhou 20 capsule absorbed an apparent space-debris impact. Their Nov. 5 departure was postponed; they departed Tiangong on Nov. 13 in the newly arrived Shenzhou 21 and were due to land at Dongfeng, Inner Mongolia early Nov. 14. Xinhua/CMSA said Shenzhou 20 had tiny cracks in the viewport and would remain in orbit for experiments. The crew had launched Apr. 24 and conducted experiments and four spacewalks.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Curiosity has successfully drilled its 44th hole on Mars”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Curiosity drilled its 44th hole within the Monte Grande hollow while investigating the boxwork unit, and planners transferred granular drill tailings to SAM and CheMin for mineralogical and evolved-gas analyses. Prior APXS and ChemCam chemistry and reflectance data had shown only subtle differences between ridge and hollow rocks, so SAM/CheMin results were critical to determining formation. Mastcam photometry and atmospheric observations were collected; the team planned further SAM experiments, tailings analyses, and a comparative ridge drilling site.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Although we didn't find any transient sources this time, our results show that even non-detections can provide powerful insights.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A Tohoku University–led team conducted the first systematic search for astrophysical counterparts to an IceCube-detected high-energy neutrino multiplet using ZTF optical data; detections spanned a month. They found no coincident supernovae, TDEs, or other transients, but used the null detection to place the tightest constraints to date on explosive events' brightness and duration. The study appeared 23 Oct in The Astrophysical Journal, and the team planned rapid follow-up observations for future multiplets.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An international team published in Science suggested that dogs' physical transformation from wolves began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than previously thought. Over more than a decade they collected and 3D-scanned over 600 canine skulls spanning 50,000 years. They revealed that nearly 11,000 years ago skull shapes diversified—shorter snouts and wider heads—and that almost half of modern breed diversity existed by the middle Stone Age, challenging the idea that Victorians chiefly drove it.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“ESCAPADE is really exciting because it's a trailblazer”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket launched NASA's two-spacecraft ESCAPADE Mars mission on its second flight and achieved its first at-sea booster landing. The liftoff occurred Nov. 13 at 3:45 p.m. EST (2045 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, and ESCAPADE was en route to Mars. ESCAPADE Principal Investigator Robert Lillis described the mission as a 'trailblazer' for a new way of doing space science.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Hydrogen infrastructure generally competed with local fresh water use.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Popular Mechanics reported that hydrogen research dated back to Paracelsus and Sir William Grove and that green hydrogen remained costly and water‑intensive. Princeton researchers proposed using acidified wastewater for electrolysis and used sulfuric acid to supply protons and prevent membrane fouling. The method raised electrolyzer stability from 8 to 300 hours, cut production costs by nearly 47%, lowered energy intensity by 62%, and recirculated the acid.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This heliophysics mission will help reveal how Mars became a desert planet.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA launched two ESCAPADE spacecraft to study how Mars’ magnetic environment was affected by the solar wind and how atmospheric loss made the planet dry. The twin Rocket Lab-built probes lifted on a Blue Origin New Glenn from Cape Canaveral at 3:55 p.m. EST; controllers established communications by 10:35 p.m. EST. The UC Berkeley-led mission also carried a Viasat communications demonstration. The launch was slightly delayed due to recent solar activity.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;We got the highest impact score ever,&quot; Sarkar said.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers led by Deblina Sarkar at MIT developed subcellular CMOS-based electronic devices hybridized with monocytes that could be injected into the bloodstream to home to brain inflammation. They addressed three challenges—making functional electronics smaller than cells, steering them by using monocyte chemotaxis instead of magnetic fields, and crossing the blood–brain barrier. Devices were about 200 nm thick and 10 µm diameter, fabricated by lithography and powered by infrared light; attaching them to monocytes remained a subsequent challenge.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““We’re harnessing the power of the shark immune system to fight human cancer.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that shark DNA contained single‑chain antibodies that could target and kill cancer cells. Work by Helen Dooley and Martin Flajnik led to using shark immune systems to create targeted antibodies; Aaron LeBeau's UW–Madison lab (with partner Elasmogen) immunized nurse sharks, isolated antibodies, and attached radioisotopes. In nude mice the labeled antibodies homed to tumors on PET scans and, when loaded with radiation, eradicated them. Preliminary macaque tests showed the antibodies were cleared without lingering in non‑target tissues.</p>

  <p class="dek">When OpenAI released open-weight models (gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b) in August, US military and defense contractors prepared to run them locally and on air-gapped systems. Firms such as Lilt welcomed the weights-accessible models for sensitive translation work despite early reports that OpenAI’s tools lagged competitors. Analysts said open weights could increase competition and reliability; a McKinsey survey found over half of businesses used open-source AI. The Pentagon planned generative-AI prototypes and had struck prototype deals with major AI firms; OpenAI did not comment.</p>

  <p class="dek">Susanne P. Schwenzer reported that during sols 4702–4708 Curiosity continued SAM analysis of the 44th drill sample, which reduced ChemCam and Mastcam work and prevented driving while the sample remained in the turret. The rover completed deliveries to CheMin and SAM, cleaned drill remnants, and would reposition to view ridge drill candidates. While stationary, Mastcam monitored drill fines and made mosaics; ChemCam and RMI investigated the Valle de la Luna hole, nearby blocks, the Monte Grande Wall and yardang unit, and atmospheric conditions were observed.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we have put together the longest and most comprehensive record of the modern Martian climate.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">During sols 4682–4688, the team reported Mars had transitioned from its &quot;cloudy season&quot; into a &quot;dusty season,&quot; expecting increased dust lifting, dust devils and potential global storms. Curiosity marked its seventh full Mars year (and 13 Earth years since landing), had produced extensive climate records via REMS and RAD, including 3,000+ cloud movies, and remained in its fifth Extended Mission. Operations prepared two planned drills in the boxwork region (first at &quot;Monte Grande&quot;) and performed coordinated APXS/ChemCam contact and SAM TLS methane measurements.</p>

  <p class="dek">Curiosity had been investigating the boxwork unit and, after drilling at Altadena in June and driving nearly a kilometer, was cleared to drill a well-preserved site. Teams planned a hollow (Valle de la Luna, Monte Grande) then an adjacent ridge. APXS and ChemCam assessed chemistry; MAHLI and Mastcam images and a pre-load test indicated the rock was suitable. The Target Acquisition Assessment Meeting approved drilling for the weekend; successful drilling would enable CheMin and SAM analyses while pausing contact-arm science for about a week.</p>

  <p class="dek">Using stereo images from CaSSIS, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, and HRSC, Valentin Bickel and colleagues applied deep learning to track dust devils seconds apart and inferred that near-surface winds on Mars were stronger and lifted more dust than previously thought. Most dust devils were found in the northern Amazonis and Elysium Planitiae (Amazonis a hotspot), peaked in southern summer and mid-morning to midafternoon, migrated poleward seasonally, and included nonvortical winds that accelerated in seconds to about 44 m/s, affecting Martian weather and climate.</p>

The observations were part of the SPAM survey led by Christina Vides, who had observed thirty young systems. Using NIRC2 with adaptive optics and aperture masking, they resolved a transition disk with an inner dust envelope, a ~40 AU gap and clumpy asymmetries suggesting gravitational perturbations. No protoplanet was confirmed, but modelling constrained possible planet locations/masses and measured accretion rates.</p>
