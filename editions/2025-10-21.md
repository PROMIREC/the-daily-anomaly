  <blockquote class="quote">“It reportedly was burning when found.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Mine workers found a smoking slab near a remote access road 19 miles east of Newman, Western Australia, on Oct. 18. Western Australia Police and the Australian Space Agency examined it and planned further analysis. Analyst Marco Langbroek said it resembled a carbon-fiber composite overwrapped pressure vessel and likely was orbital debris — possibly the Chinese Jielong 3 upper stage that reentered Oct. 18.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“We were able to identify dust devils in over 50,000 satellite images.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An international team led by Dr. Valentin Bickel (University of Bern) analyzed over 50,000 CaSSIS and HRSC images with deep learning and tracked 300 stereo dust-devil sequences to measure movements. Their Oct. 8, 2025 Science Advances paper reported vortex-driven winds reached up to 44 m/s (160 km/h), far above prior typical Mars wind speeds (&lt;50 km/h, rarely ~100 km/h). They concluded stronger winds could have lifted much more dust, affecting Martian atmospheric dynamics, surface features, climate models and mission planning.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The country’s scurrying to try to see how we can get these [REEs]”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences described a recycling method that used flash joule heating and chlorine gas to separate rare earth elements from waste magnets. Ground magnets were demagnetized at 800° C, ground, then rapidly heated with an electric current to thousands of degrees while chlorine converted non-REE metals to volatile chlorides that vaporized and deposited on the chamber, leaving REE oxides/oxychlorides on a carbon platform for collection. They analyzed Gibbs free energy and tested NdFeB and SmCo waste.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Windscreen being sent to NTSB laboratories for examination.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The National Transportation Safety Board said it investigated a United Airlines 737 MAX whose windscreen was struck mid-flight over Utah on Thursday during a Denver–Los Angeles flight. Social-media images showed a cracked cockpit window and a pilot’s arm cut by glass; the aircraft diverted and landed safely in Salt Lake City and remained pressurized around 36,000 ft. The captain called the object &quot;space debris,&quot; but the origin was unconfirmed and meteor, balloon, hail or a high-altitude bird were suggested; lab analysis was underway.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“SpaceX had the contract for Artemis III.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA said it was opening Artemis crewed-landing contracts to other companies after SpaceX fell behind schedule, interim head Sean Duffy said, and the agency would not wait for one firm. SpaceX had held a $2.89bn 2021 contract to develop the Starship lunar lander. NASA had announced December delays that pushed an orbital Artemis mission to April 2026 and a moon landing to mid-2027. Other partners included Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper; Starship had multiple failed launches since 2023.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">FUNDING CUTS SPARK MALARIA SURGE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““Cutting funding risks the deadliest resurgence we’ve ever seen.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Analysts warned slashed contributions by wealthy countries to the Global Fund could have allowed a malaria resurgence, costing millions of cases, hundreds of thousands of deaths and billions in GDP by 2030. The report, commissioned by Malaria No More UK and the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, estimated a 20% funding shortfall would have caused 33 million extra cases, 82,000 deaths and $5.14bn lost GDP; a collapse would have caused 525 million more cases, 990,000 deaths (750,000 under five) and $83bn lost GDP.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“absolutely not send any reply until after the issue was discussed at the United Nations.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The IAA revised SETI protocols as searches expanded beyond radio to include lasers and Dyson swarms. A preprint on arXiv and a vote at the 2025 IAC in Sydney proposed the largest change in 36 years, prescribing researcher protections from online harassment, verification steps, dual geographic data storage, software access, and advising against replying to a detected direct message until the UN reviewed it. The update did not change METI debates and recommended petitioning the ITU to clear radio bandwidth if needed.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">BACKYARD SPACE REHEARSALS EXPOSE FLAWS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“using a simulation, which in this field was more commonly known as an analog”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described how researchers used Earth-based simulations, called analogs, to prepare for human space exploration. It explained that hostile planetary environments required extensive planning, testing and technological development, so analog missions employed extreme terrestrial sites and habitat mock-ups to replicate Moon or Mars conditions. Teams studied crew performance and procedures, tested instruments, found tasks such as operating tools in thick gloves and bulky suits were problematic, and identified needed changes before launch while training crews.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“From many, one, as the saying goes.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Radio astronomers had used interferometry—correlating time-stamped signals from arrays—to create virtual large antennas. Optical telescopes rarely needed it, but a 2025 study proposed applying Kernel Phase Interferometry (KPI) to single high-resolution images (via Fourier transforms) to create a virtual aperture array. KPI had similar artifacts but better isolated close sources, enabling direct imaging of Earth-sized exoplanets and close binaries from existing JWST and other data without new observations.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SPACEX COULD LOSE MOON CONTRACT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The problem is, they're behind.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">NASA had awarded SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract in April 2021 to modify Starship as the crewed lunar lander for Artemis 3, but acting NASA chief Sean Duffy said SpaceX was behind schedule and announced he would open the contract to competition, naming Blue Origin. Blue Origin had won a $3.4 billion HLS contract for Blue Moon for Artemis 5. Musk questioned Blue Origin’s readiness. Artemis 3's schedule had shifted due to Starship testing and issues with spacesuits, Orion and other hardware.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MIRACLE IMPLANT RESTORES SIGHT</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“80 percent of participants reported seeing better.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Several dozen patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) regained some central vision after receiving a 2-by-2-mm photovoltaic retinal implant paired with camera-equipped smart glasses, a study in The New England Journal of Medicine reported. The glasses sent zoomed images via near-infrared light to the implanted device, which pulsed electrical signals to the optic nerve. Of 38 implanted patients, 32 completed one year and 26 (80%) saw better; vision remained blurry and black-and-white. Science Corporation acquired the technology from Pixium Vision in 2024.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“In the history of artificial vision, this represents a new era.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An electronic eye implant, the sim card-shaped Prima device, was implanted in 38 elderly patients with geographic atrophy (dry AMD) across 17 sites. The operation lasted less than two hours and the implant was half the thickness of a human hair. The trial found 84% of participants regained the ability to read letters, numbers and words, restoring meaningful central vision; clinicians described the results as a new era for treating previously untreatable dry AMD.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“non-relativistic spin splitting”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">DARPA's Defense Sciences Office issued an RFI titled &quot;Altermagnetism for Devices&quot; and explored altermagnetism, a recently identified magnetic class that combined ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic features. It exhibited &quot;non-relativistic spin splitting,&quot; producing magnetic behavior without net field, which DARPA said could enable circuits to manipulate electron spin with far lower energy and interference. The agency sought materials and approaches to use spintronics not just for storage (e.g., MRAM) but for ultralow-energy computation by switching and controlling spin states like transistors.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“ABS-201 works by shunting the dormant hair follicles back into a different phase of the hair cycle called the anagen phase.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Absci developed ABS-201, an AI-designed injectable antibody that targeted the prolactin receptor and shifted dormant hair follicles from telogen into anagen, encouraging regrowth. Preclinical trials produced full hair regrowth in macaques after six months and in mice within 22 days, outperforming minoxidil. The company used AI to optimize antibody binding, potency, and immunogenicity. Absci and partners noted injectable dosing could improve adherence and ABS-201 bypassed the shedding phase associated with minoxidil.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the journey a seed takes from arrival to cold storage”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">As biodiversity declined, the Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst, West Sussex, had collected and stored seeds for 25 years, holding them in trust for countries worldwide. To mark the anniversary, Patrick Greenfield toured the site and described to Madeleine Finlay the journey a seed took from arrival to cold storage, and how some seeds had already aided the return of endangered plant species to the wild.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This is maybe the first direct evidence that we've preserved the proto-Earth materials,&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists identified possible first direct evidence of material from the proto-Earth preserved in deep rocks, in a study published Oct. 14 in Nature Geoscience. Co‑led by Nicole Nie, the team detected a deficit of potassium‑40 in ancient rock, which they argued was a fingerprint of pre–giant‑impact material that survived the Moon‑forming collision about 4.5 billion years ago. The work built on 2023 meteorite potassium‑isotope analyses showing isotopic differences could trace Earth’s building blocks.</p>

  <p class="dek">Since launching in 2008, the MIT Global Seed Funds (GSF) had awarded $30 million to more than 1,300 faculty projects. Administered by the MIT Center for International Studies, GSF combined a general fund with 20+ region- and institution-specific funds. Its projects produced patents, policy changes, and papers in Nature and Science. Roughly 300 proposals were submitted this year; examples included crutches in Sierra Leone, LLMs to predict grocery energy use, and Cape Verde research linking drought-driven food-price rises to anemia. GSF emphasized 'reciprocal exchange.'</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The No. 1 cause of the damages and deaths from hurricanes is storm surge.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Hurricanes were described as America’s most destructive natural hazards, causing more than US$1.5 trillion in damage and over 7,000 deaths since 1980. The author stated that storm surge was the primary cause of those harms, defined by sea-level rise from winds, low pressure and wave setup. Accurate high-resolution surge forecasts were critical but slow, and the author had explored using physics-based models and artificial intelligence to speed forecasting.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The doves’ mixed responses suggest that individual experience or innate bias can strongly shape how an animal interprets illusions.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article described a study that tested whether animals perceived the Ebbinghaus illusion. Researchers compared 38 ring doves and 19 guppies, reasoning that doves' binocular, detail-oriented terrestrial foraging would favor local processing while guppies' rapid, cluttered aquatic environment would favor global processing. Subjects chose between two cards showing arrays of circles with food centers. Guppies were highly susceptible, choosing items surrounded by smaller circles; doves showed mixed responses, suggesting individual or innate biases and local perceptual strategies.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“you could expand your consciousness.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Google researcher Hartmut Neven proposed in a paper in Entropy that consciousness arose from quantum effects and could be tested by entangling a human brain with a quantum computer. His team assumed brains contained qubits and that entanglement with a quantum computer would create an expanded quantum superposition yielding richer subjective experience, which would support quantum theories of consciousness and might illuminate coma awareness and neurological disorders. The idea built on Penrose’s Orch OR framework.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“When those glaciers go, sea levels will rise by more than a meter.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">In 2014 NASA announced that part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet had reached irreversible retreat, with peripheral glaciers losing ice faster than snowfall and receding inland. That would raise sea level by more than a meter and potentially 5 meters if the whole sheet collapsed. A 2016 study proposed a runaway ice-cliff collapse accelerating retreat, prompting IPCC worst-case scenarios of over 2 meters by 2100 and 15 meters by 2300, though many scientists remained unconvinced and debated timelines.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“different meteorites have different potassium isotopic signatures, and that means potassium can be used as a tracer of Earth’s building blocks”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists analyzed potassium-40 isotopes in meteorites and ancient terrestrial rocks and compared them with typical Earth samples to search for a preserved pre-Moon-formation (proto-Earth) component. They found different potassium isotope ratios in meteorites versus most Earth material and identified ancient Greenland, Canadian and Hawaiian mantle-derived samples whose potassium signature suggested they predated the Moon-forming giant impact. The study was led by Nicole Nie and published in Nature Geoscience.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““A human being looks like a collection of particles, but really, it’s all waves.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Scientists increasingly entertained wave-based models of consciousness. The article described that instead of neurons-as-switches, consciousness could arise from resonant fields—brain waves that overlapped and produced a unified experience—while neurons still relayed signals and chemicals. Physicist Michael Pravica argued in a submitted paper that humans were interference holograms formed by overlapping infrared radiation and de Broglie wave functions, and he proposed these wave functions could stretch beyond space-time and possibly connect people, living or deceased; the idea was presented as controversial.</p>

The NNSA red‑teamed frontier Claude instances in an AWS Top Secret environment and provided feedback. Anthropic and the NNSA co‑developed a nuclear classifier based on a controlled but unclassified NNSA list of risk indicators to flag harmful conversations while avoiding false positives; both parties remained vague about actual chatbot risk.</p>

  <p class="dek">Around 6,000 years ago hunter-gatherers settled the Bogotá Altiplano and later transitioned to agriculture; researchers recovered fragmented DNA from skeletal remains and found no ancient relatives or modern descendants. The individuals were genetically distinct from Indigenous Colombians and showed greater affinity to people on the Isthmus of Panama and Chibchan speakers. Scientists analyzed mtDNA and genome-wide data from 21 ancient individuals (6,000–500 years old) and published results in Science Advances.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“they must really exist.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Virtual particles were described as a clever mathematical tool, invented by Richard Feynman, used to calculate subatomic interactions and to represent forces (electromagnetism, strong, weak). They were not real or directly detectable, but calculations using them matched experiments to 12 decimal places, prompting debate whether the tool reflected reality. As ephemeral carriers in a bookkeeping scheme, they briefly borrowed energy from empty space via quantum fuzziness, explaining how forces acted across empty space.</p>
