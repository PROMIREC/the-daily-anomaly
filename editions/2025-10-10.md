  <h3 class="hed">250 FILES BACKDOOR GIANT LLMS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“data-poisoning attacks might be more practical than believed”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Anthropic released a report that investigated data-poisoning attacks on large language models. The study showed attackers could backdoor models by inserting a small, roughly constant number of malicious documents into pretraining data rather than a percentage. Researchers successfully backdoored models of 600 million to 13 billion parameters using only 250 malicious documents. The work was done with the UK AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">NOBEL PRIZE FOR GAS-SLURPING CRYSTALS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“A small amount of such material can be almost like Hermione’s handbag in Harry Potter.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Three scientists — Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi — were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, sharing 11m Swedish kronor, for developing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). They combined metal ions and organic molecules into highly porous crystals that could store and release gases and be tailored for tasks such as harvesting water, capturing CO2, removing toxins, storing hydrogen and recovering rare earths. Robson began the work in 1989; Kitagawa and Yaghi stabilized and diversified MOFs.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“This work fundamentally changes how we understand hail formation.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Peking University’s Qinghong Zhang used stable isotope analysis to reconstruct formation histories of 27 hailstones from nine Chinese storms and mapped the atmospheric layers where they formed. Only one stone showed the classic recycling; 10 formed while steadily descending, 13 with a single upward push, and 3 with near‑horizontal movement. Embryos formed between −33.4 and −8.7 °C; larger hail required at least one upward growth in the −30 to −10 °C zone. Zhang said this could improve forecasting.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">STUDY SAYS MOAI 'WALKED' HOME</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“'walking' from the quarry to their platforms”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Easter Island's moai were built about 800 years ago and scholars debated how they were transported. Carl Lipo's hypothesis proposed they were moved vertically by ropes, effectively 'walking' to their ahu, a claim reflected in Rapa Nui oral traditions. Lipo's team had previously shown in 2012 that 18 people and three ropes could move a 10‑ft, 5‑ton moai and later studied hats and placement. A new Journal of Archaeological Science paper presented 3D physics modeling and fresh field tests to connect theory and experiment and address scale critiques.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">LYFT ORDERS ROBOT TAXIS BY HUNDREDS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Tensor Robocars flip this model, turning personal luxury vehicles into productive assets that can generate income around the clock.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Lyft partnered with San Jose-based Tensor Auto, reserved &quot;hundreds&quot; of robotaxis and planned to operate a fleet. Tensor made its Robocar &quot;Lyft-ready&quot; so vehicles shipped with Lyft's platform could generate owner income in level-4 regions. Tensor planned first deliveries by end of 2026; the Robocar included over 100 sensors (37 cameras, five lidars, 11 radars), eight NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs capable of 8,000 trillion operations, and was to be produced in Vietnam with VinFast. Bloomberg said this was Lyft's first purchased AV fleet.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">UNSEEN ASTEROID ZOOMS PAST EARTH</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It made a pass around 428 km above the southern continent.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An asteroid, 2025 TF, passed about 428 km above Antarctica on 1 October and made the second-closest known Earth approach; astronomers detected it only after closest approach. Estimated at 1–3 m across, it would have produced a fireball if it had entered the atmosphere. Kitt Peak’s Bott Telescope first spotted it hours later, with follow-up from the Catalina Sky Survey and ESA using Las Cumbres. The report noted small, dark objects threatened orbital infrastructure and that better surveys were lacking.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ANIMALS SPEAK SECRET NAMES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Hey, Dave, over here!”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Guardian commentary argued that animal communication was more complex than commonly assumed and should be understood on animals' terms rather than forced into human frameworks. It described dogs using buttons and categorising toys, elephants using low-frequency, individual-addressing calls, dolphins inventing signature whistles and using &quot;motherese&quot;, songbirds having regional dialects, and sperm whales combining click patterns into a phonetic-like system within tight social groups. The author warned against anthropocentric misinterpretation.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Xiphodracon translates to sword-like dragon.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A near-complete skeleton found on Dorset's Jurassic coast was identified as a new ichthyosaur species, Xiphodracon goldencapensis, the 'sword dragon of Dorset' and the only known example. Discovered at Golden Cap in 2001 and later acquired by a Canadian museum, it was only recently analysed and described in a paper. About 3 m long and dated to ~185 million years ago, it had a long sword-like snout, enormous eye socket, a prong-like bone near the nostril, and skull marks suggesting a fatal bite.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;one-step engineering of CAR-NK cells&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT and Harvard researchers developed a new way to engineer CAR-NK cells that reduced immune rejection and could enable off-the-shelf treatments. Their one-step approach was faster than traditional multiweek methods. In mice with humanized immune systems the engineered CAR-NK cells destroyed most cancer cells while evading host immunity. The senior authors were Jianzhu Chen and Rizwan Romee; lead author was Fuguo Liu; the paper appeared in Nature Communications. NK cells killed targets by degranulation releasing perforin.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ECLIPSE DUPES BIRDS INTO DAWN CHORUS</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“It's crazy that you can turn off the sun, even briefly, and birds' physiology is so tuned to those changes that they act like it's morning.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">During the April 2024 North American total solar eclipse, researchers at Indiana University used a crowdsourced app (SolarBird), automated recorders and BirdNET to analyze nearly 100,000 bird vocalizations and about 11,000 public observations from more than 1,700 users. They found that 29 of 52 species altered vocal behavior before, during or after totality; 12 species responded during totality (some fell silent, others sang more), and 19 species produced a false dawn chorus as sunlight returned. The study was published in Science on Oct. 9.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MORE INTERSTELLAR COMETS SOON</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“the icy core of 3I/ATLAS is somewhere between the size of the Empire State Building to something a little larger than Central Park.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, passed near Mars while en route to perihelion at the end of the month; it was the third interstellar object detected after 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Discovered on July 1, it passed within about 20 million miles of Mars and would not approach Earth closer than roughly 170 million miles in December, limiting imaging. Hubble and JWST constrained its nucleus size and spectroscopy found water vapor and a strong carbon‑dioxide signature; it reached about 152,000 mph and then exited the Solar System.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">HIDDEN CHEMICAL ORDER SURVIVES PROCESSING</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“You can never completely randomize the atoms in a metal.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT researchers found that subtle short-range chemical patterns in metal alloys persisted in manufactured metals and were not erased by processing. In a Nature Communications paper they identified a new physical phenomenon explaining the persistence, developed a simple predictive model, and showed how engineers could tune patterns to alter properties for aerospace, semiconductors, and nuclear reactors. The work was led by Rodrigo Freitas with co-first authors Mahmudul Islam, Yifan Cao and Killian Sheriff, and was supported by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">MIT DOUBLES ATOMIC CLOCK PRECISION</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“We think our method can help make these clocks transportable and deployable to where they’re needed.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">MIT physicists improved optical atomic clock stability by reducing quantum noise and harnessing a laser-induced “global phase” in ytterbium atoms, boosting that effect with quantum amplification. The method, called global phase spectroscopy and reported in Nature, doubled the precision of an optical atomic clock and was expected to scale with atom number. The team said the technique could stabilize lasers for portable optical clocks for uses such as dark-matter and dark-energy searches, tests of fundamental forces, and earthquake prediction.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“we perform initial satellite health checks and prepare to raise the satellites to their assigned altitude of 392 miles (630 km)”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Twenty-four Amazon Project Kuiper satellites were scheduled to launch Oct. 11 from Cape Canaveral atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 at 8:51 p.m. EDT after a 48-hour delay from Oct. 9. It was SpaceX's third Kuiper launch and the sixth overall toward a planned ~3,200-satellite network; 129 satellites had been launched. The upper stage was to deploy them at 289 miles (465 km) and they were to be raised to 392 miles (630 km); the booster was to land on droneship Just Read the Instructions.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the far side of the Moon is also its colder side”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Chinese researchers analyzed Chang'e-6 samples from Apollo Crater (South Pole–Aitken Basin) and reported in Nature Geoscience that the lunar far side had been colder. They examined 1,935.3 g of returned material (300 g allotted to BRUIG) with electron probes and inferred the basalts formed at ~1,100 °C—about 100 °C cooler than near-side samples. They attributed this to a mantle depleted in heat-producing elements (K, U, Th—KREEP), and discussed impact and gravitational hypotheses for the asymmetry.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“evolved a DNA repair mechanism”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers reported that naked mole rats, subterranean rodents with a nearly 40-year maximum lifespan, had evolved a DNA repair mechanism that could explain their longevity and resistance to age-related diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration and arthritis. Led by Tonji University and published in Science, the study focused on DNA repair using an undamaged strand as template and found that the protein cGAS, which impeded repair in humans, aided repair and preserved genomic integrity in naked mole rats.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">TESLA SELF-DRIVER UNDER FIRE</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“induced vehicle behavior that violated traffic safety laws”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The US NHTSA opened a probe into 2.88 million Tesla EVs equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) after receiving more than 50 reports of traffic-safety violations and numerous crashes. The agency said FSD had 'induced vehicle behavior that violated traffic safety laws,' including running red lights and driving against traffic; six reports alleged entering intersections on red and crashing. The preliminary evaluation could lead to a recall. NHTSA had investigated Smart Summon and 2021 Model Y door handles; Tesla contested release of specific crash data.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Starship is the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX moved the Super Heavy booster to the orbital launch mount at Starbase in South Texas, posting photos on X on Oct. 8 ahead of Starship Flight 11, scheduled for Oct. 13 at 7:15 p.m. EDT. The two-stage Starship stood about 400 feet tall and used 33 Raptor engines on Super Heavy and six on Ship. Flight 11 followed Flight 10’s profile, planned a controlled Super Heavy splashdown in the Gulf and Ship’s deployment of eight dummy Starlink payloads before an Indian Ocean splashdown.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“I saw images with some oxygen, but OMG it [was] faint.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Astrophotographer Greg Meyer captured a star-studded nebula resembling a colossal baboon in Corona Australis about 500 light-years away, with blue reflection nebulas forming its eyes. The feature, nicknamed the Rampaging Baboon Nebula, appeared near globular cluster NGC 6723 (≈30,000 light-years away). Meyer collected 16.5 hours of data over 13 nights (June–August) from Starfront Observatory using an Esprit 120mm telescope and QHY 268M camera, then processed the frames in Photoshop, Lightroom and PixInsight.</p>
