  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;This is strong evidence that as stars evolve off their main sequence they can quickly cause planets to spiral into them and be destroyed.&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The study surveyed more than 400,000 post‑main‑sequence stars using TESS and detected 130 close-in planets (33 new candidates). It found close-orbit gas giants occurred at about 0.28% overall, ~0.35% for stars just entering the post‑main sequence and ~0.11% for the oldest red giants, indicating stellar aging removed close planets. Tidal forces were implicated in orbital decay or disruption. The Sun was expected to reach that phase in ~5 billion years; Earth might survive but life likely would not. PLATO was planned to study older giants.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The 29 Starlink satellites were deployed about 65 minutes after launch.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">SpaceX extended its single-year launch record on Nov. 10 by launching 29 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral aboard a Falcon 9 that lifted off at 10:21 p.m. EST (0321 GMT Nov. 11). The first stage (booster 1096) landed on the drone ship Just Read the Instructions 8.5 minutes later on its third flight; the upper stage deployed the satellites about 65 minutes after launch. The mission was the 144th Falcon 9 launch and 104th Starlink flight of 2025, bringing total liftoffs to 149.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“A shockingly large amount of sensitive traffic is being broadcast unencrypted.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Cybersecurity researchers used a commercial off-the-shelf satellite dish on a San Diego campus to scan internet traffic routed via 39 geostationary satellites visible from southern California. They intercepted vast quantities of unencrypted private voice calls, SMS, in‑flight Wi‑Fi and sensitive corporate, government, military and critical‑infrastructure communications. The data could be passively observed with inexpensive consumer hardware; many satellites used outdated equipment and often did not employ cryptography. The examined satellites represented about 15% of the geostationary fleet.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“about 10-15 bright meteors an hour”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The Leonids meteor shower was active from early November to early December and peaked on the night of 16–17 November. The meteors, from the former tail of comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, produced about 10–15 bright meteors per hour, entered the atmosphere at roughly 70 km/s and left straight, lingering trails. No storm was predicted for 2025. UK and other northern-hemisphere viewers were advised to watch in the early hours (chart showed east from London at 00:00 on 16–17 November) and to dress warmly, bring a deck chair and be patient.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“G-FLight (Gravity-independent Filamented Light)”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers at ETH Zurich printed muscle tissue in simulated microgravity during parabolic flights using a biofabrication system called G-FLight. They aimed to avoid gravity-induced stress on bioinks that hindered replication of human muscle fibers on Earth. The work was presented as a step toward manufacturing vascularized tissues and functional organs for transplantation, advancing space medicine and addressing astronaut muscle loss; related efforts had printed retinas, liver tissue, bladders, windpipes, and planned heart tests on the ISS.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“The early Universe was an incredibly crowded place.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">A cosmological simulation recreated the first 700 million years of a dwarf galaxy and showed two intense starburst episodes that produced dense stellar clusters. Those clusters migrated to the galactic center and merged into a massive nuclear star cluster, whose core collapse could have seeded intermediate-mass and then supermassive black holes rapidly, explaining how such monsters appeared within several hundred million years without new physics. The result supported dense star-cluster formation as a leading explanation for JWST’s early “little red dots.”</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““It’s your body trying to get rid of the irritant.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Capsaicin, the active chemical in chillies, acted on TRPV1 receptors in nociceptors rather than taste buds, triggering autonomic responses (tearing, sweating, runny nose) that tried to expel the irritant. People varied in enjoyment because of TRPV1 gene variants and receptor desensitisation. Some other chemicals and receptors (TRPA1, TRPM8) caused different sensations, and historically chillies had been eaten since ~7000BC; the hot-sauce market was projected to reach $5bn by 2030.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“[Colossal] gave my family a second chance with a clone of our beloved dog.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Starting with Dolly in 1996, animal cloning had provoked moral debate and public skepticism (Pew 2017; Gallup 2025). Canine cloning succeeded in 2005; the pet-cloning industry expanded to serve wealthy clients — dog clones averaged $50,000 (cats half that). Colossal Biosciences acquired Viagen, and Tom Brady said Colossal had cloned his dog Lua as Junie. Critics noted dogs were not endangered, clones shared genetics only and could differ in personality, and funds might better aid shelter animals amid high euthanasia and intake numbers.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“urability addresses the minimal physical, chemical, and energetic requirements for life to originate.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Viktória Fröhlich and Zsolt Regály (Konkoly Thege Miklós Astronomical Institute) examined the 'urability' of moons bound to planets ejected by supernovae in a paper for Astronomy and Astrophysics. They defined urability as the minimal physical, chemical and energetic requirements for life to originate, distinct from habitability. They noted several hundred rogue planets had been found and theories predicted up to two Jupiter-sized rogues per star. Using simulations they tested exomoon orbital dynamics (circular and eccentric orbits, two-moon resonances) while varying SN II parameters.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“Yet every single step is an extraordinary act of coordination, driven by precise timing between spinal cord, brain, nerves, muscles and joints.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">The article explained that walking was a complex, precisely timed coordination among spinal cord, brain, nerves, muscles and joints. Historically people had used stopwatches, cameras or trained observers to assess gait; recent advances in motion capture, wearable sensors and data‑science (including AI) could record and quantify step‑by‑step movement. Authors declared affiliations and funding: Matthew Bird had received Department of Defense funding, two coauthors had no relevant conflicts, and Oklahoma State University provided funding to The Conversation US.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“OH absorption was detected on the 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz lines.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">An observatory in South Africa using MeerKAT (64 antennas, 13.5 m each) detected OH radio absorption at the 1665 and 1667 MHz lines from interstellar object 3I/Atlas on October 24, five days before perihelion. That OH absorption was consistent with cometary outgassing (sublimation) and explained the radio pattern without implying technology. Earlier MeerKAT attempts on Sept. 20 and 28 failed. Avi Loeb had urged monitoring and noted only the OH absorption was reported; further observations were recommended.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">ELITE FEW NEVER FORGET FACES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“Do you have an uncanny recall for faces?”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Research discussed in the podcast described a small number of &quot;super recognisers&quot; who had uncanny facial memory and could, for example, recognise the same extra in TV shows decades apart. University of New South Wales research indicated they naturally selected the most useful facial features to encode memories. Dr David Robertson spoke with Ian Sample about their lives, scientific findings, and potential public‑good applications; listeners were directed to tests to see if they were super recognisers.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;aiming for another attempt as soon as Wednesday&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Blue Origin postponed New Glenn’s second launch from Cape Canaveral after rain, a ground-system issue and cumulus cloud cover closed an 88-minute window. The company said, in coordination with the FAA, it aimed for another attempt Wednesday between 2.50pm and 4.17pm EST. The flight was to carry NASA’s Escapade twin spacecraft to Mars and to test booster recovery after January’s flight placed its payload in orbit but failed to land the reusable first stage. Competition with SpaceX and policy pressures on NASA were noted.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“China just broke its single-year launch record”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">China broke its single-year launch record with 72 orbital missions after four weekend launches, surpassing last year's 68. On Nov. 8 a Long March 11H carried three Shiyan-32 tech-test satellites; on Nov. 9 a Long March 12 deployed broadband satellites for the SatNet megaconstellation (planned for 13,000). Private Kinetica-1 (Lijian-1) placed two Earth-observation test satellites, while a Ceres-1 upper-stage anomaly destroyed three. The U.S. led globally with &gt;150 launches; Falcon 9 had flown 143 times.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">SAT SOLVERS CRACK GREAT MATH PUZZLES</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">““I really want to see AI solve the first problem that humans cannot.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Marijn Heule used satisfiability (SAT) solvers to resolve long-standing combinatorics and geometry problems—such as the empty hexagon, Schur Number 5 and Keller’s conjecture in dimension seven—and believed SAT could be combined with large language models to tackle even harder pure-math problems. SAT was described as symbolic AI that used true/false logic and produced sound but often unreadable proofs. Heule, trained at Delft and mentored by Hans van Maaren, coauthored a 1,500-page SAT textbook and concluded automated reasoning needed nonhuman approaches.</p>

  <p class="dek">Danna Freedman was the faculty director of the nascent MIT Quantum Initiative (QMIT), which aimed to apply quantum breakthroughs to major challenges across science, technology, industry, and national security. The Institute-wide, interdisciplinary effort sought to bring together MIT researchers, domain experts, and companies, and formally launched on Dec. 8. QMIT planned a campus hub, collaboration with the U.S. government and MIT Lincoln Laboratory on hardware, systems engineering and rapid prototyping, and engagement across health, physics, cybersecurity, materials, and sensing.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">““Veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were often exposed to airborne hazards such as burn pits and dust storms.””</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers presenting at the ACAAI annual meeting analyzed VA Corporate Data Warehouse records for 48,000 U.S. veterans deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and their matched non-deployed peers, reviewing health data since they served 22 years ago. Deployed veterans, who had no prior respiratory diagnoses, showed higher risks: asthma +55%, chronic rhinitis +41%, chronic rhinosinusitis +27%, and nasal polyposis +48%. Exposures cited included burn pits and dust storms; median deployment age was 26.7 and most were white males.</p>

  <h3 class="hed">EQUATORIAL MAGNETIC FIELD REVERSED</h3>
  <blockquote class="quote">“The electric force and charge distribution are both results, not causes, of plasma motion.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Researchers in Japan used satellite observations and large-scale MHD simulations to show that near Earth's equator the magnetosphere's charge polarity was reversed from the traditional view: the morning side was negative and the evening side was positive, while polar regions retained the expected polarity. They attributed the latitudinal switch to plasma motion along oppositely oriented magnetic field lines, concluding that electric forces and charge distributions resulted from plasma flows. The finding informed understanding of near-Earth space and other planets.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“the scientific case for edible insects in space is compelling.”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">Long before human orbital flight, insects had proven they could survive space: fruit flies reached space in 1947 and many species later aided microgravity studies. The ESA evaluated insects as a food source for long Moon and Mars missions, citing their nutritional efficiency and demonstrated microgravity life cycles, and cricket flour even flew to the ISS. Regulators authorised some species in 2023, but multi‑generational breeding, microgravity housing, processing and crew acceptance remained unresolved.</p>

  <blockquote class="quote">“&quot;spinning in the opposite direction to its orbit&quot;”</blockquote>
  <p class="dek">October–November 2024, the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA collaboration detected two unusual black‑hole mergers, GW241011 and GW241110. GW241011, ~700 million light years away, involved 20 and 6 solar‑mass black holes and showed one of the fastest primary spins seen; GW241110, ~2.4 billion light years away, involved 17 and 8 solar‑mass black holes and had a primary spinning opposite its orbit. Both unequal‑mass, high‑spin systems were interpreted as likely second‑generation hierarchical mergers in dense clusters; GW241011 also matched Kerr‑predicted deformations and higher harmonics, testing general relativity.</p>
