<span class="badge">Evidence: Medium</span>

**Claims**
- Meta-optical systems enabled new interactions with light and could miniaturize optics, potentially reducing mobile-phone camera lens size.
- TMOS envisioned applications such as projection-glasses, novel cameras, and cheaper miniature sensors for early disease detection.

**Facts / Evidence**
- TMOS’s meta-optical systems consisted of millions of nanostructures that allowed light interactions not possible with larger-scale optical systems.
- The work was led by Professor Dragomir Neshev at Australia’s ARC Centre of Excellence for Transformative Meta-Optical Systems.

> We Are Actually Very Close to This Science Fiction

Australia’s ARC Centre for Transformative Meta-Optical Systems (TMOS), led by Professor Dragomir Neshev, developed meta-optical systems composed of millions of nanostructures that manipulated light in ways not possible with conventional optics. TMOS aimed to miniaturize optics to shrink mobile-phone camera lenses and envisaged applications including projection-glasses, novel cameras, and lower-cost miniature sensors for early disease detection.
