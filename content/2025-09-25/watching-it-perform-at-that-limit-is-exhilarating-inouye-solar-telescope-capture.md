**Claims**
- The Inouye Solar Telescope captured the clearest H-alpha image of a solar flare to date.
- Coronal loop strands in the observed X1.3 flare averaged 48.2 km in width and narrowed to about 21 km in places.

**Facts / Evidence**
- The flare occurred on August 8, 2024.
- It was the first time the Inouye Solar Telescope had observed an X-class flare.

> "Watching it perform at that limit is exhilarating"

The NSF’s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope captured the highest-resolution H-alpha image yet of an X1.3-class solar flare on August 8, 2024. The observations resolved coronal loop strands during the flare’s decay, reporting average loop widths of 48.2 km and sections as narrow as 21 km; the team included scientists from NSF, LASP, CIRES, and University of Colorado Boulder.
