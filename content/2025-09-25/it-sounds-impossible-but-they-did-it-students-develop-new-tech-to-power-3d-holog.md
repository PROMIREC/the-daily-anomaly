**Claims**
- Students developed Quantum Multi-Wavelength Holography using IR illumination and visible-light entanglement to capture phase and intensity for true 3D holograms.
- The team presented the work at the Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics and claimed it could solve phase-wrapping and enable infrared imaging without an infrared camera.

**Facts / Evidence**
- Undergraduates Moe (Yameng) Zhang and Wenyu Liu led the project under Petr Moroshkin and Professor Jimmy Xu.
- The method used two spectra: infrared light to illuminate targets and visible light entangled with the infrared for imaging.

> It sounded impossible, but they did it.

Brown University students developed a microscopic imaging technique, Quantum Multi-Wavelength Holography, that used infrared illumination and visible-light entangled photons to capture intensity and phase and produce 3D holographic images. The undergraduate-led work was supervised by Petr Moroshkin and Professor Jimmy Xu, was presented at the Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics, and was reported to address phase-wrapping and enable infrared imaging without an infrared camera.
