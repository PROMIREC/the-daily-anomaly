**Claims**
- Nature conducted the largest-ever survey of quantum physicists and found a persistent lack of consensus on the theory's interpretation.
- The interpretational divide focused on options ranging from the Copenhagen interpretation to the Many-Worlds hypothesis.

**Facts / Evidence**
- A 2016 survey of 149 physicists found most viewed interpretations as important but fewer felt well-versed in them.
- The 100th-anniversary Nature survey reported the schism among physicists persisted.

> quantum mechanics remained one of the most profound—and puzzling—theories

A recent report found that, a century after its development, quantum mechanics remained considered profound and puzzling and many physicists still disagreed about its meaning. A 2016 survey of 149 researchers had found most thought interpretations were important but felt less well-versed; Nature later ran the largest-ever survey marking quantum theory’s 100th anniversary and reported the schism persisted, centered on interpretations from Copenhagen to Many-Worlds.
