<span class="badge">Evidence: High</span>

**Claims**
- Novel X-ray technology allowed researchers to closely observe snow and soil motion and reveal intricate swirls and loops affecting particle movement.
- The study confirmed a long-standing hypothesis about how granular particles slip and slide.

**Facts / Evidence**
- The research was led by a University of Sydney team and was reported in a paper in Nature Communications.
- Authors suggested potential applications in construction, grain storage, landslide understanding, and future Martian habitation.

> Granular materials are everywhere.

A University of Sydney-led team used novel X-ray technology to observe snow and soil movement and reported findings in Nature Communications that confirmed a long-standing hypothesis about how granular particles slip and slide. The researchers identified intricate swirls and loops (secondary flows) that affected material motion and suggested applications for landslides, construction, grain storage, and future Martian habitation.
