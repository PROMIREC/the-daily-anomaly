**Claims**
- SUPER demonstrated following a person jogging through a forest and avoided thin obstacles while moving at 20 meters per second or more.
- Developers said SUPER would be used for search-and-rescue or disaster relief and outpaced earlier MAVs limited to open or race-track environments.

**Facts / Evidence**
- SUPER stood for "safety-assured high-speed aerial robot".
- It was developed by a team led by Yunfan Ren at the University of Hong Kong.

> safety-assured high-speed aerial robot

An agile new micro air vehicle called SUPER (safety-assured high-speed aerial robot) demonstrated that it could follow a person jogging through forested terrain and avoid thin obstacles like power lines while exceeding 20 meters per second. Its Hong Kong developers said it used onboard sensing and computing, aimed at search-and-rescue and disaster relief, and outpaced earlier MAVs that had operated only in open or race-track environments.
