**Claims**
- A previously unseen subglacial flood erupted to the surface, cracking the Greenland ice sheet.
- Current models attempting to predict the ice sheet’s future did not account for meltwater pressure, leaving a significant blind spot.

**Facts / Evidence**
- Approximately 90 million cubic meters of water exited an 85‑meter‑deep crater over 10 days (summer 2014).
- Researchers identified about 385,000 m² of fractured and warped ice and a scoured surface twice the size of Central Park.

> current models... did not account for meltwater pressure

Researchers reported that a massive subglacial flood in summer 2014 released about 90 million cubic meters of water through an 85‑meter‑deep crater in Greenland over 10 days, cracking the ice and producing 385,000 m² of fractured ice and a scoured surface twice the size of Central Park. They said the event was previously unobserved and noted that current models did not account for meltwater pressure.
