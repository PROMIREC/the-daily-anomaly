**Claims**
- X-37B OTV-8 was scheduled to launch Aug. 21, 2025 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Kennedy Space Center.
- The payload included next-generation communications lasers and a quantum inertial sensor to support communications resilience and navigation in GPS‑denied environments.

**Facts / Evidence**
- The mission was a partnership between the U.S. Space Force and the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, with involvement from the Air Force Research Lab and Defense Innovation Unit.
- The lasers would test infrared in-space laser communications and concepts for proliferated commercial satellite networks in Low Earth Orbit.

> resilience, efficiency, and security of U.S. space-based communications architectures

The U.S. Space Force, with the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, prepared to launch the eighth X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV-8) on Aug. 21, 2025 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Kennedy Space Center. The mission carried next‑generation infrared communications lasers to demonstrate in‑space laser communications and a quantum inertial sensor intended to provide navigation in GPS‑denied environments; the Air Force Research Lab and Defense Innovation Unit were involved.
