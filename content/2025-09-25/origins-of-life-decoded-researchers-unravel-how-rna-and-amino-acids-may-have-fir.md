**Claims**
- Researchers devised theoretical early Earth conditions under which RNA and amino acids could combine to form the origin of life.
- They demonstrated spontaneous, selective linking of amino acids to RNA using simple chemistry in water at neutral pH.

**Facts / Evidence**
- The work was presented in a paper in Nature.
- Senior author was Professor Matthew Powner; the article described ribosomes as the molecular machines that synthesize proteins guided by RNA.

> We have achieved the first part of that complex process.

University College London researchers reported in Nature that they had devised theoretical earlyâ€‘Earth conditions under which RNA and amino acids could combine, and had demonstrated spontaneous, selective linkage of amino acids to RNA in water at neutral pH. They stated this chemistry could have occurred on early Earth and represented a step toward showing how RNA might have first come to control protein synthesis and the origin of life.
